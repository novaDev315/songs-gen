## Formatting Tips for Pop

### Emphasis & Energy:
- **CAPS** = Louder, more powerful delivery
- **ellipses...** = Slower, contemplative pacing
- **! marks** = Energy and excitement
- **Lo-o-o-ng** = Sustained notes

### Vocal Effects:
- `(whispered: "text")` = Soft delivery
- `(shouted: "TEXT")` = Aggressive delivery
- `(Background: "harmonies")` = Background vocals
- Parentheses alone = Call-and-response

### Sound Effects:
- `*bass drop*`
- `*synth build*`
- `*crowd cheering*`
- `*vinyl crackle*` (for lo-fi pop)

### Pop-Specific Tags:
- `[Catchy Hook]`
- `[Vocal Run]`
- `[Ad-libs]`
- `[Harmonies]`
- `[Beat Drop]`
