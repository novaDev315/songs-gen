## The Build Principle

Multi-singer songs work best with energy progression:

```
1. INTIMATE: Single voice (PHOENIX soft or NEON)
2. BUILDING: Two voices (PHOENIX + NEON)
3. EXPLOSIVE: All voices (PHOENIX + NEON + REBEL)
4. VULNERABLE: Pull back (NEON solo or PHOENIX soft)
5. MAXIMUM: All voices maximum energy
```

Example Flow:
```
Verse 1 (PHOENIX alone)
→ Pre-Chorus (PHOENIX + NEON)
→ Chorus (ALL)
→ Verse 2 (REBEL rap)
→ Chorus (ALL bigger)
→ Bridge (NEON emotional)
→ Final Chorus (ALL MAXIMUM)
```

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Have all personas sing everything (becomes muddy)
- Switch personas randomly without reason
- Use conflicting style directions simultaneously
- Forget to specify persona descriptions in style prompt
- Use more than 3-4 personas (too complex)

### ✅ DO:
- Assign clear roles to each persona
- Build energy through persona additions
- Create contrast (soft PHOENIX → aggressive REBEL)
- Specify all personas in style prompt
- Use strategic placement for maximum impact

---

## Alternative Persona Combinations

### For Country/Folk:
```
PHOENIX (powerful female) + SAGE (intimate indie male) + JAZZ (sultry vintage female)
```

### For Rock:
```
PHOENIX (powerful female) + WOLF (aggressive rock male) + REBEL (edgy female)
```

### For R&B/Soul:
```
JAZZ (sultry soul female) + NEON (smooth R&B male) + PHOENIX (powerful leads)
```

### For Ballad:
```
PHOENIX (emotional female) + NEON (gentle male) [2 personas for intimacy]
```
