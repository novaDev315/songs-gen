- **ellipses...** = Jazz phrasing, delayed/relaxed timing
- **Hyphens** = Scat syllables (doo-be-doo-wah)
- **! marks** = Accented notes in solos
- **CAPS** = Use sparingly - jazz is typically smooth

### Vocal Effects:
- `(sultry: "smooth delivery")` = Romantic, intimate
- `(scat: "improvised syllables")` = Scatting sections
- `(crooning: "smooth male")` = Male jazz vocal style

### Sound Effects & Atmosphere:
- `*walking bass*`
- `*brushed drums*`
- `*piano arpeggios*`

- `*trumpet mute*`
- `*cymbal shimmer*`
- `*double bass pluck*`
- `*snare brush*`
- `*jazz club ambience*`
- `*vinyl crackle*` (for vintage feel)

### Jazz-Specific Tags:
- `[Instrumental]` (Very common - many jazz pieces work better instrumental)
- `[Saxophone Solo]`
- `[Piano Solo]`
- `[Trumpet Solo]`
- `[Bass Solo]`
- `[Drum Solo]`
- `[Scat Section]`

## Pro Tips from the Guides

1. **Female Vocals = Suno's Jazz Strength**: 1920s-1950s female jazz vocals produce excellent results
2. **Era Specification is Critical**: "1940s era" or "1950s West Coast" provides instant sonic context
3. **Consider Instrumental**: Many jazz pieces work better with `[Instrumental]` tags and minimal vocals
4. **Walking Bass + Brushed Drums**: Always specify these for authentic jazz feel
5. **Complex Chord Progressions**: Mention "complex chords," "sophisticated harmony" in prompt
6. **BPM Variance**: Ballads (80-100), Swing (110-140), Bebop (160-200+)
7. **Scat Needs Explicit Notation**: Write out "Bah-dah-doo" - AI won't add it spontaneously
8. **Solo Section Structure**: Use rhythm notation (! . ! . .) or [Instrumental] tags
9. **Mix with Other Genres**: "Jazz with soul," "Jazz with blues," "Jazz with hip-hop" for unique fusion
10. **Vintage Production**: Add "vintage tone," "warm analog," "vinyl aesthetic" for authentic feel
