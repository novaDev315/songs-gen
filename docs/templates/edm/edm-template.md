## Formatting Tips for EDM

### Emphasis & Energy:
- **CAPS** = Maximum energy, powerful moments
- **ellipses...** = Atmospheric, floating, contemplative
- **! marks** = High energy, excitement, drops
- **Repetition** = "go go go go", "higher higher higher"

### Vocal Effects:
- `(echoed: "text")` = Echo/delay effect
- `(pitched up: "text")` = Higher pitched vocals
- `(chopped: "text text text")` = Vocal chops
- `(filtered: "text")` = Low-pass filter sweep
- Parentheses = Background/layered vocals

### Sound Effects:
- `*bass drop*`
- `*wobble bass*`
- `*synth riser*`
- `*white noise build*`
- `*sidechain pump*`
- `*laser zap*`
- `*impact hit*`
- `*crowd screaming*` (for festival vibes)

### EDM-Specific Tags:
- `[Intro Build]`
- `[Drop]` or `[Bass Drop]`
- `[Breakdown]`
- `[Build-Up]`
- `[Melodic Section]`
- `[Vocal Chops]`
- `[Instrumental Break]`
- `[Filter Sweep]`

### Production Terminology:
Include these in your style prompt for authentic EDM sound:
- **supersaw leads** = Thick, detuned synth sound
- **sidechain compression** = Pumping effect with kick drum
- **wobble bass** = LFO-modulated bass (dubstep)
- **reese bass** = Layered detuned bass (drum & bass)
- **pluck synths** = Short, percussive synth hits
- **arpeggiator** = Rapid note patterns
- **white noise** = Build-up and transition elements
- **sub-bass** = Deep low-frequency bass

## Pro Tips from the Guides

1. **For Difficult Sub-genres**: Repeat genre name 3 times: "Drum and bass, drum and bass, drum and bass..."
2. **Production Specificity**: Include exact production terms (sidechain, supersaw, wobble bass) for authentic sound
3. **Drop Structure**: Build tension for 16-32 bars before drop for maximum impact
4. **Vocal Chops**: Use (chopped: "word word word") for EDM vocal effects
5. **Wide Stereo**: Mention "wide stereo" or "spatial imaging" for big festival sound
6. **Build-Up Effects**: Use *riser*, *white noise build*, *snare roll* before drops
7. **Minimal Lyrics in Drops**: Let the production shine - drops should be mostly instrumental
8. **Energy Mapping**: Plan your energy curve: intro (medium) → build (rising) → drop (maximum) → breakdown (low) → repeat
9. **BPM Precision**: Stay within genre BPM ranges - it affects the entire vibe
10. **Sidechain Pumping**: Mention "sidechain compression" or "pumping" for authentic EDM groove
