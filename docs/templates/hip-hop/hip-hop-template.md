Southern/Atlanta: Include slang like "yeah", "uh", "skrrrt", "facts"
West Coast: Laid-back delivery markers: (smooth), (chill)
NYC: Aggressive markers: (hard), (gritty), emphasis on wordplay
Memphis: Dark markers: (haunting), (aggressive), phonk elements
```

### Ad-Libs Library:
```
"Yeah!", "Uh!", "Let's go!", "Ay!", "Skrrrt!", "Woo!",
"Facts!", "Real!", "Uh-huh!", "What!", "Hey!", "Bow!"
```

### Sound Effects:

2. **For Better Flow**: Break lines where you want natural pauses/breathing
3. **For Complex Rhymes**: Write internal rhymes within lines, not just end rhymes
4. **For Energy**: Use CAPS on emphasized words, not entire sections
5. **Mix Hip-Hop with Other Genres**: "Hip-hop with soul", "Hip-hop with blues", "Hip-hop with country"
6. **Repeat Genre Name 3x**: For difficult sub-genres: "Phonk, phonk, phonk, Memphis style..."
