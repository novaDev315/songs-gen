## 💡 Key Discoveries & Best Practices

### Discovery #1: The 2-3 Persona Sweet Spot
- **Optimal**: 2-3 distinct voices
- **Why**: More than 3 becomes muddy, less than 2 lacks dimension
- **Exception**: Can use "CHOIR" as 4th for specific moments

### Discovery #2: Contrast is King
```
Good Contrast Examples:
- Soft verse (PHOENIX) → Aggressive rap (REBEL)
- Female power (PHOENIX) → Male vulnerability (NEON)
- Rap verses (REBEL) → Sung choruses (PHOENIX)
```

### Discovery #3: The Build Principle
Each section should build on the previous:
1. Start intimate (single voice)
2. Add harmonies (two voices)
3. Explode with all voices
4. Pull back for bridge
5. Maximum finale

### Discovery #4: Genre-Specific Applications

**For Pop:**
- PHOENIX: 60% (main melody)
- NEON: 25% (harmonies/bridge)
- REBEL: 15% (rap break/attitude)

**For Hip-Hop:**
- REBEL: 50% (verses)
- PHOENIX: 30% (hooks)
- NEON: 20% (melodic elements)

**For EDM:**
- PHOENIX: 40% (main vocal)
- NEON: 30% (breakdowns)
- REBEL: 30% (energy bursts)

Neon love in laser beams
Dancing through ELECTRIC DREAMS!

Binary emotions, take a chance (chance)
Upload my heart into your drive (upload)
In this matrix, we're alive (alive)
