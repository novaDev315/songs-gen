# Persona Selection Guide: Matching Voices to Your Lyrics

## Quick Selection Process

Use this guide to choose the right persona combination for YOUR specific song lyrics and theme.

---

## Step 1: Analyze Your Song's Characteristics

### Ask yourself:

**1. What's the emotional journey?**
- Single emotion throughout? → 1-2 personas
- Emotional progression/contrast? → 2-3 personas
- Multiple perspectives? → 2-3 personas with distinct voices

**2. What's the energy level?**
- Intimate/soft throughout? → Gentle personas (NEON, SAGE)
- High energy throughout? → Powerful personas (PHOENIX, REBEL, WOLF)
- Builds from soft to explosive? → Mix (start NEON/SAGE, add PHOENIX)
- Contrasting sections? → Strategic persona switches

**3. Is there rap content?**
- No rap? → PHOENIX + NEON (no REBEL needed)
- Rap verses + sung chorus? → REBEL (rap) + PHOENIX (chorus)
- Occasional rap break? → Add REBEL for that section only
- Heavy rap focus? → REBEL dominant + others for hooks

**4. What's the theme/mood?**
- Romantic/Vulnerable → NEON lead or PHOENIX soft + NEON
- Empowerment/Confidence → PHOENIX lead + REBEL attitude
- Dark/Mysterious → PHOENIX whispered + NEON haunting
- Party/Celebration → ALL three with high energy
- Storytelling/Narrative → Single voice (PHOENIX or SAGE) or duet conversation
- Aggressive/Angry → WOLF + REBEL or PHOENIX powerful
- Nostalgic/Reflective → NEON or SAGE with JAZZ accents

**5. What's the vocal texture needed?**
- Smooth and polished? → PHOENIX + NEON
- Edgy and raw? → REBEL + WOLF
- Soulful and vintage? → JAZZ + NEON
- Modern and diverse? → PHOENIX + NEON + REBEL (golden formula)

## Step 5: Red Flags & When to Simplify

### Use FEWER Personas If:
- ❌ Lyrics are simple/repetitive → Don't overcomplicate with many voices
- ❌ Song is under 2 minutes → Not enough space for multiple personas
- ❌ Theme is focused/intimate → Multiple voices can dilute emotion
- ❌ You're a beginner → Start with 1-2 personas, master those first

### Use MORE Personas If:
- ✅ Song has distinct sections with different emotions
- ✅ Lyrics include both rap and singing
- ✅ You want commercial pop production sound
- ✅ Theme involves multiple perspectives/characters
- ✅ Song is 3+ minutes with clear sections

## Common Mistakes in Persona Selection

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using rap persona when no rap
```
Lyrics: All singing, no rap content
Wrong: PHOENIX + NEON + REBEL
Right: PHOENIX + NEON only
Reason: REBEL's strength is rap/attitude - wasted if unused
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Too many personas for simple song
```
Lyrics: Simple love song, repetitive structure
Wrong: PHOENIX + NEON + REBEL + JAZZ
Right: PHOENIX + NEON OR just PHOENIX
Reason: Simple songs need focus, not complexity
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not matching persona to emotion
```
Lyrics: Soft, vulnerable, intimate throughout
Wrong: PHOENIX powerful + REBEL aggressive
Right: NEON soft + PHOENIX gentle
Reason: Match vocal style to lyrical emotion
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Switching personas without reason
```
Verse 1 (NEON) → Verse 2 (REBEL) → Verse 3 (PHOENIX)
Why switching? If no lyrical reason, creates confusion
Right: Use same voice for same type of content
```

## Advanced: Custom Combinations

### Beyond the Golden Formula

Don't feel locked into PHOENIX+NEON+REBEL. Match personas to YOUR lyrics:

**For Country/Folk lyrics:**
```
PHOENIX + SAGE (powerful + intimate male)
OR: JAZZ + NEON (vintage + smooth)
```

**For Rock lyrics:**
```
PHOENIX + WOLF (powerful female + aggressive male)
OR: WOLF + REBEL (male + female rock aggression)
```

**For R&B/Soul lyrics:**
```
JAZZ + NEON (sultry + smooth)
OR: PHOENIX + JAZZ (power + soul)
```

**For Indie/Alternative lyrics:**
```
SAGE + PHOENIX (intimate male + female contrast)
OR: SAGE solo (consistent indie voice)
```

## Final Checklist

Before finalizing persona selection:

- [ ] Does each persona have a clear PURPOSE in my lyrics?
- [ ] Am I using rap personas only if I have rap content?
- [ ] Do persona switches align with lyrical/emotional shifts?
- [ ] Is the distribution realistic? (not all personas equal unless intentional)
- [ ] Am I keeping it simple if my lyrics are simple?
- [ ] Do personas match the emotional tone of their sections?
- [ ] Have I avoided overcrowding (max 3-4 personas)?
- [ ] Does the combination fit my genre AND my specific lyrics?

---

## Remember

**The personas serve YOUR lyrics, not the other way around.**

1. Write or concept your lyrics first
2. Identify emotional sections and their needs
3. Choose personas that fit THOSE specific needs
4. Assign personas strategically to sections
5. Test and iterate

The "golden formula" (PHOENIX+NEON+REBEL) works great for commercial pop, but YOUR song might need something different. Trust your creative instincts and match voices to your specific content.
