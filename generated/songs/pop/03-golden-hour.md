## Lyrics

**[Intro - Instrumental]**
*(Warm guitar, soft synths, golden atmosphere)*

**[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]**
Six PM sunlight painting your face
Everything's perfect in this time and place
The world goes quiet when you're near
Magic happens when you're here

**[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(PHOENIX leads)* Don't let this MOMENT fade away
*(NEON harmonizes)* We got FOREVER in today
*(Together)* In this GOLDEN light we'll stay!

**[Chorus - PHOENIX lead, NEON harmonies]**
This is our GOLDEN HOUR!
When the world feels like it's OURS!
Every second has the POWER!
To make us feel ALIVE!
GOLDEN HOOOUR! *(hour, hour, hour)*
Time is standing STILL for us!
GOLDEN HOOOUR! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*
In this PERFECT light we trust!

**[Verse 2 - NEON]**
Your laugh sounds like a melody
The way you look at me sets me free
No filter needed, you're the real thing
Better than a diamond ring

**[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(PHOENIX leads)* Don't let this MOMENT fade away
*(NEON harmonizes)* We got FOREVER in today
*(Together)* In this GOLDEN light we'll stay!

**[Chorus - ALL]**
This is our GOLDEN HOUR!
When the world feels like it's OURS!
Every second has the POWER!
To make us feel ALIVE!
GOLDEN HOOOUR! *(hour, hour, hour)*
Time is standing STILL for us!
GOLDEN HOOOUR! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*
In this PERFECT light we trust!

**[Rap Break - REBEL]**
*(Beat gets groovier, rhythmic)*
Yo, check the VIBE, it's immaculate
Sun going DOWN but we passionate
Living in the NOW, no past or future
This moment's GOLD, yeah we the producers
Camera ROLL, capturing the feeling
Heart and SOUL, this is healing
Magic HOUR, got that power
Making MEMORIES in this golden shower! *(of light)*

**[Bridge - NEON emotional]**
*(Music softens, intimate)*
When darkness comes *(comes)*
We'll remember this *(this)*
How the light made EVERYTHING
Feel like a KISS *(kiss)*
Freeze this frame *(frame)*
Hold it close to me *(me)*
Golden hour LOVE
For eternity *(eternity)*

**[Final Chorus - ALL maximum energy]**
This is our GOLDEN HOUR! *(GOLDEN HOUR!)*
When the world feels like it's OURS! *(IT'S OURS!)*
Every second has the POWER! *(THE POWER!)*
To make us feel ALIVE! *(SO ALIVE!)*
GOLDEN HOOOUR! *(hour, hour, hour)*
Time is standing STILL for us! *(STILL FOR US!)*
GOLDEN HOOOUR! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*
In this PERFECT light we TRUUUST!

**[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(Warm synths, guitar fading)*
*(PHOENIX)* Golden hour... *(hour)*
*(NEON)* Our golden hour...
*(Together)* Forever golden... *(yeah)*
This perfect light... *(mmm)*
