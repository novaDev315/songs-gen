## Lyrics
[Intro]
*Soft ambient pads*
. . . . .

[Verse 1]
Colors fade across the screen
The softest hues I've ever seen
Pixels dancing in the night
A digital delight

[Chorus]
DIGITAL SUNSET
Glowing through the air
DIGITAL SUNSET
Beauty everywhere
Let the moment stay
As the world fades away
Digital sunset...

[Verse 2]
Neon dreams and purple skies
Reflections in your weary eyes
Tomorrow waits beyond the glow
But for now just let it flow

[Chorus]
DIGITAL SUNSET
Glowing through the air
DIGITAL SUNSET
Beauty everywhere
Let the moment stay
As the world fades away
Digital sunset...

[Outro]
*Ambient fade*
. . . . . . . . .
