## Lyrics
[Intro]
*synth melody*

[Verse 1]
Walking through the city lights
Everything feels so alive tonight
Heart is beating to the sound
Of dreams I finally found

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it in the air?
Magic floating everywhere

[Chorus]
WE'RE UNSTOPPABLE, we're on fire
Rising higher and HIGHER
Nothing's gonna bring us down
We own this town... TONIGHT!

[Verse 2]
Every step I take is bold
This story's waiting to be told
No more hiding in the shade
Watch me shine, I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it in the air?
Magic floating everywhere

[Chorus]
WE'RE UNSTOPPABLE, we're on fire
Rising higher and HIGHER
Nothing's gonna bring us down
We own this town... TONIGHT!

[Bridge]
(soft)
When the world gets loud...
I just turn it UP!
*bass drop*

[Final Chorus]
WE'RE UNSTOPPABLE, we're on FI-I-IRE!
Rising higher and HI-I-IGHER!
Nothing's gonna bring us down
We own this town... TONIGHT!
TONIGHT!

[Outro]
*fade out with synth*
We're unstoppable...
