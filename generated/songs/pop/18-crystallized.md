## Verse 1
We were liquid once, flowing wild and free
Rivers running, no direction, you and me
But somewhere in the chaos, temperature dropped
And what we were became something time stopped

Now we're perfect, frozen, caught between
The most beautiful thing that I've ever seen
Like snowflakes forming patterns in the air
Geometric, symmetric, beyond compare

## Pre-Chorus
Pressure and time
Turned coal into diamond
But diamonds don't breathe
They just shine in the silence

## Chorus
We crystallized, under the weight of it all
Turned into something that will never fall
Unbreakable, unmeltable, perfectly preserved
Is this the ending that we deserved?
We crystallized, every moment, every kiss
Frozen forever in the amber of this
Beautiful, untouchable, cold to hold
We crystallized before we could grow old

## Verse 2
I can see every facet when the light breaks through
Every angle, every color, every shade of you
Refracting memories into rainbow beams
Solid now where we used to be liquid dreams

They say that diamonds last eternally
But eternity feels lonely, can't you see?
I'd trade forever for one moment more
Of being fluid like we were before

## Pre-Chorus
Pressure and time
Turned coal into diamond
But diamonds don't breathe
They just shine in the silence

## Chorus
We crystallized, under the weight of it all
Turned into something that will never fall
Unbreakable, unmeltable, perfectly preserved
Is this the ending that we deserved?
We crystallized, every moment, every kiss
Frozen forever in the amber of this
Beautiful, untouchable, cold to hold
We crystallized before we could grow old

## Bridge
(Minimal instrumentation, intimate vocals)
Maybe if I shatter
All these perfect patterns
We could melt again
Back to what we were then

But I'm afraid of breaking
What we spent so long making
This beautiful prison
This perfect precision

(Building orchestration)
Ice, ice, baby we're frozen in time
Slice through the structure, one crack at a time
Nice doesn't mean that we're actually alive
Twice we could burn if we just survive

## Final Chorus
We crystallized, under the weight of it all
Turned into something that will never fall
Unbreakable, unmeltable, perfectly preserved
Is this the ending that we deserved?

Let's crystallize, every moment, every kiss
Choose forever in the amber of this
Beautiful, untouchable, mine to hold
We'll crystallize before we grow old

## Outro
(Delicate, with crystal-like bell sounds)
Crystalline tears, crystalline fears
Crystallized through all these years
Crystalline light, crystalline night
We're diamonds now, forever bright

(Sustained note with shimmering harmonics fading)

Clear...

**Production Notes**:
- Begin with sparse piano and intimate vocals
- Introduce glassy, crystalline synth textures that chime and shimmer
- Use glockenspiel and celeste for delicate, ice-like tones
- Layered vocal harmonies creating choir-like atmosphere
- Subtle string arrangements adding emotional depth
- Reverb and delay create sense of space and frozen time
- Bridge features experimental use of glass sounds (wine glasses, bottles)
- Percussion uses metallic, crystalline samples instead of traditional drums
- Dynamic range from whisper-quiet to soaring crescendos
- Outro features actual crystal bowl recordings or similar ethereal tones
- Overall production pristine and clean, almost too perfect
