## Verse 1
Started with a spark in the dark
Your eyes like flint, struck straight to my heart
One touch and I'm burning alive
No water, no shelter, nowhere to hide

I tried to be careful, tried to stay cool
But you're the match and I'm gasoline fuel
Every warning sign that I ignored
Now I'm craving the heat, begging for more

## Pre-Chorus
They say don't play with fire
But I've never felt higher
Smoke signals rising up to the sky
I'm gone, I'm gone

## Chorus
I got a wildfire heart, can't put it out
Flames getting louder, hear me shout
Burning through the night, burning through the pain
Dancing in the ashes, dancing in the rain
I got a wildfire heart, spreading too fast
Nothing stays forever, nothing can last
But while it's blazing, while it's bright
I'll be your wildfire, wildfire heart tonight

## Verse 2
Smoke in my lungs, heat on my skin
The world's evacuating but I'm running in
They're calling the sirens, telling me to run
But I've never felt more alive under this sun

Your lips taste like danger wrapped in desire
Every kiss adds fuel to the fire
Reckless and burning, out of control
You're the wildfire consuming my soul

## Pre-Chorus
They say don't play with fire
But I've never felt higher
Smoke signals rising up to the sky
I'm gone, I'm gone

## Chorus
I got a wildfire heart, can't put it out
Flames getting louder, hear me shout
Burning through the night, burning through the pain
Dancing in the ashes, dancing in the rain
I got a wildfire heart, spreading too fast
Nothing stays forever, nothing can last
But while it's blazing, while it's bright
I'll be your wildfire, wildfire heart tonight

## Bridge
Let it burn, let it burn, let it all come down
We're a forest fire tearing through this town
No regrets when the morning comes around
We'll be legends in the smoke
Rising from the ground

(Instrumental break with pulsing synths and building percussion)

Phoenix from the flames
Can't remember my own name
Just the heat and you and me
Setting everything free

## Final Chorus
I got a wildfire heart, can't put it out
Flames getting louder, hear me shout
Burning through the night, burning through the pain
Dancing in the ashes, dancing in the rain
I got a wildfire heart, spreading too fast
Nothing stays forever, nothing can last
But while it's blazing, while it's bright
I'll be your wildfire, wildfire heart tonight

## Outro
Wildfire, wildfire, wildfire heart
Burn it down, tear it apart
Wildfire, wildfire, from the start
You and me, wildfire heart

(Fading with crackling fire sound effects and distant echoing vocals)

- Heavy four-on-the-floor kick drum with crisp hi-hats
- Layered synth pads creating warmth and intensity
- Vocal harmonies with slight distortion on "wildfire" repetitions
- Build tension with rising white noise sweeps
- Drop features explosive bass and bright synth stabs
- Bridge strips down to vocals and sparse percussion before final build
- Use crackling fire samples subtly throughout
- Reverb-drenched vocals in outro for atmospheric fade
