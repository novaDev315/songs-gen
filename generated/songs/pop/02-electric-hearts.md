## Lyrics

**[Intro - PHOENIX ad-libs]**
*(Pulsing synths, digital effects)*
Electric... electric... *(ooh-ooh)*
Can you feel it? *(yeah)*

**[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]**
Caught your signal through the digital noise
Binary heartbeat, I hear your voice
Pixels and passion on my glowing screen
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen

**[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(PHOENIX leads)* We're WIRED in the same frequency
*(NEON harmonizes)* Connected by this ENERGY
*(Together)* Our love's electric, can't you SEEEE?

**[Chorus - PHOENIX lead, NEON harmonies]**
We got ELECTRIC HEARTS beating in sync!
Faster than LIGHT, faster than you think!
VOLTAGE rising, can't turn it off!
This digital LOVE, we're taking off!
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(hearts, hearts, hearts)*
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(we're lighting up the dark)*
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*

**[Verse 2 - NEON]**
Late-night texts turning into calls
Breaking through these virtual walls
Your emoji smile makes my system restart
You're the upgrade to my broken heart

**[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(PHOENIX leads)* We're WIRED in the same frequency
*(NEON harmonizes)* Connected by this ENERGY
*(Together)* Our love's electric, can't you SEEEE?

**[Chorus - ALL]**
We got ELECTRIC HEARTS beating in sync!
Faster than LIGHT, faster than you think!
VOLTAGE rising, can't turn it off!
This digital LOVE, we're taking off!
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(hearts, hearts, hearts)*
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(we're lighting up the dark)*
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*

**[Rap Break - REBEL]**
*(Beat switches, harder edge)*
Yeah, we're CODED in the same language
Love.exe, no need to manage
Streaming LIVE, no buffering
This connection's the real thing
Swipe RIGHT, match made in the cloud
Hearts beating ELECTRIC, beating LOUD
No glitch, no lag, we're synchronized
Our love's the APP that's optimized!

**[Bridge - NEON emotional]**
*(Music strips down, vulnerable)*
When the Wi-Fi's gone *(gone)*
And the power's off *(off)*
Will you still be REAL with me?
Beyond the SCREEN we see? *(see)*
'Cause I need to KNOW *(know)*
This isn't just a SHOW *(show)*
That what we have is TRUE...

**[Final Chorus - ALL maximum energy]**
We got ELECTRIC HEARTS beating in sync! *(IN SYNC!)*
Faster than LIGHT, faster than you think! *(YOU THINK!)*
VOLTAGE rising, can't turn it off! *(TURN IT OFF!)*
This digital LOVE, we're taking off!
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(hearts, hearts, hearts)*
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(we're lighting up the dark)*
ELECTRIC HEARTS! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*
We got ELECTRIC HEAAARTS!

**[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(Synths fading, heartbeat rhythm)*
*(PHOENIX)* Electric...
*(NEON)* Hearts...
*(Together)* Forever connected... *(connected)*
Electric hearts... *(yeah)*

## Why This Works

**Vocal Chemistry (Golden Formula)**
- **PHOENIX (60%)**: Carries the digital-age emotion with powerful, clear vocals that cut through electronic production
- **NEON (25%)**: Provides warmth in the second verse and vulnerable bridge, humanizing the tech theme
- **REBEL (15%)**: Delivers tech-savvy rap with modern slang and rhythm

**Production Elements**
- Pulsing synths create "electric" atmosphere
- Digital sound effects (glitches, beeps) add authenticity
- Beat drop on rap section for energy shift
- Stripped-down bridge creates emotional contrast

**Thematic Coherence**
- Modern love language (apps, Wi-Fi, streaming)
- Questions digital vs. real connection in bridge
- Balances tech terminology with genuine emotion
- Synth-pop production matches lyrical content

## Generation Tips

1. **Vocal Recording**:
   - PHOENIX: Bright, futuristic tone; use auto-tune subtly for effect
   - NEON: Warm and human to contrast digital theme; raw emotion on bridge
   - REBEL: Confident, tech-savvy delivery with swagger

2. **Production Focus**:
   - Heavy synth bass and arpeggios
   - Digital glitch effects throughout
   - Pulsing heartbeat rhythm in low end
   - Vocoder effects on "electric hearts" in outro

3. **Mix Priorities**:
   - Keep vocals pristine despite heavy production
   - Use side-chain compression for pumping effect
   - Bridge should strip away most production (just synth pad + vocals)
   - Final chorus needs maximum digital energy

4. **Key Moments**:
   - Extended "SEEEE" with vocoder effect
   - Bridge vulnerability must shine through production
   - Rap section beat switch should be dramatic
   - "HEAAARTS" final note with vocal runs and reverb
