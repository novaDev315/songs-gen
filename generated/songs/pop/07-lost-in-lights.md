## Style Prompt

Create a shimmering electro-pop track with pulsing synths, atmospheric pads, and a hypnotic groove. PHOENIX delivers breathy, sensual lead vocals with emotional depth, NEON adds ethereal harmonies that float like city lights, and REBEL brings urban edge with rhythmic vocal chops. Production should feature lush synth textures, deep sub-bass, crisp percussion, and spatial effects that create an immersive nighttime cityscape. Think nocturnal wandering through neon-lit streets with a dreamy, intoxicated feel.

**Instrumentation**: Synthesizers (analog and digital), deep bass, electronic drums, vocal chops, ambient pads, subtle guitar plucks

**Vocal Production**: PHOENIX (breathy lead with reverb), NEON (layered ethereal harmonies), REBEL (chopped vocal effects, rhythmic elements)

**Mix Style**: Wide stereo imaging, deep low-end, shimmer on high frequencies, heavy use of reverb and delay for dreamlike atmosphere

## Lyrics

### [Intro]
**[NEON - ethereal harmonies with vocal chops]**
Lost, lost, lost in the lights
Lost, lost, lost in the night
**[REBEL - chopped vocal effects]**
In the lights, in the lights, in the lights

### [Verse 1]
**[PHOENIX - breathy, intimate delivery]**
City's glowing like a fever dream
Neon signs paint everything
Walking streets I've never seen
Don't know where I am or where I've been

**[PHOENIX - continuing]**
Strangers' faces blur to gold
Stories that will never be told
Something magic in the air tonight
Pull me deeper into the lights

### [Pre-Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - building emotion]**
And I'm falling, falling
Into something I can't name
**[NEON - layered harmonies]**
(Can't name, can't name)
**[PHOENIX]**
Yeah, I'm calling, calling
But I don't know who to blame

### [Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - soaring lead]**
I'm lost in lights, lost in lights
Don't know wrong from right
**[NEON - floating harmonies]**
(In the city glow, city glow)
**[PHOENIX]**
Lost in lights, hypnotized
By the way they shine so bright
**[NEON - ethereal backing]**
(Let me go, let me go)
**[PHOENIX - emotional climax]**
I don't wanna find my way back home tonight

### [Verse 2]
**[PHOENIX - vulnerable delivery]**
Skyscrapers touch the midnight sky
Music pumping as I pass by
Every color feels so alive
In this moment, I could fly

**[REBEL - rhythmic spoken delivery]**
Yeah, the city's got a heartbeat
Feel it pumping in the concrete
Every corner's a new story
I'm swimming in the glory

### [Pre-Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - building emotion]**
And I'm falling, falling
Into something I can't name
**[NEON - layered harmonies]**
(Can't name, can't name)
**[PHOENIX]**
Yeah, I'm calling, calling
But I don't know who to blame

### [Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - soaring lead]**
I'm lost in lights, lost in lights
Don't know wrong from right
**[NEON - floating harmonies]**
(In the city glow, city glow)
**[PHOENIX]**
Lost in lights, hypnotized
By the way they shine so bright
**[NEON - ethereal backing]**
(Let me go, let me go)
**[PHOENIX - emotional climax]**
I don't wanna find my way back home tonight

### [Bridge]
**[REBEL - atmospheric spoken/sung]**
Take me where the shadows dance
Where the night gives me a second chance
**[PHOENIX - stripped down, emotional]**
I could stay here forever
Let the city lights surround me
**[NEON - building harmonies]**
(Surround me, surround me, never let me down)
**[PHOENIX]**
In this beautiful disaster
Let the rhythm finally found me

### [Final Chorus - Extended]
**[PHOENIX - powerful delivery]**
I'm lost in lights, lost in lights
Don't know wrong from right
**[NEON - massive harmonies]**
(In the city glow, city glow)
**[PHOENIX]**
Lost in lights, hypnotized
By the way they shine so bright
**[NEON]**
(Let me go, let me go)
**[ALL - unified]**
I don't wanna find my way
I could stay lost for days
**[PHOENIX - final line]**
Don't wanna find my way back home tonight

### [Outro]
**[NEON - fading ethereal vocals]**
Lost in the lights, lost in the lights
Lost in the lights tonight
**[REBEL - final vocal chop]**
In the lights, in the lights
**[PHOENIX - whispered]**
Lost in lights

## Production Tips

1. **Synth Design**: Use analog warmth for bass, digital shimmer for leads, create movement with filter sweeps and LFO modulation
2. **Vocal Effects**: Heavy reverb and delay on PHOENIX lead for dreamlike quality, pitch-shifted layers from NEON for ethereal feel, chop and process REBEL vocals as rhythmic elements
3. **Rhythm Section**: Deep sub-bass with sidechain compression, crisp hi-hats with shuffle groove, minimal kick pattern that drives without overpowering
4. **Spatial Effects**: Wide stereo panning on harmonies, ping-pong delay on vocal phrases, long reverb tails for atmosphere
5. **Build Technique**: Add synth layers progressively through song, drop elements in bridge, bring everything back with extra shimmer in final chorus
6. **Reference Tracks**: The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights", CHVRCHES' "The Mother We Share", M83's "Midnight City"
