## Style Prompt

Create an edgy pop-rock track with driving electric guitars, punchy drums, and synth layers. PHOENIX delivers powerful lead vocals with a raw edge, NEON adds soaring harmonies in the chorus for anthemic lift, and REBEL injects attitude with half-sung/half-rapped verses. Production should feature distorted guitar riffs, heavy bass, and stadium-ready dynamics. Think pop-punk energy meets modern pop production - gritty but polished.

**Instrumentation**: Electric guitars (rhythm and lead), synthesizers, bass guitar, live drums with electronic enhancement, hand claps

**Vocal Production**: PHOENIX (lead with slight grit), NEON (layered harmonies), REBEL (attitude-driven delivery with rhythmic flow)

**Mix Style**: Wide stereo field, punchy drums, compressed vocals for radio-ready sound, dynamic build from verses to explosive choruses

## Lyrics

### [Intro]
**[PHOENIX - spoken with attitude]**
They say stay in line
But I was never good at following signs

### [Verse 1]
**[PHOENIX - lead vocal, confident]**
Told me play it safe, don't make a sound
Keep your head down, feet on the ground
But I got fire burning in my veins
Can't be tamed by their old champagne

**[REBEL - rhythmic delivery]**
Nah, I don't fit your perfect mold
Got my own story that needs to be told
You can judge me, I don't really care
I'll be dancing like nobody's there

### [Pre-Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - building intensity]**
Watch me light it up, light it up tonight
**[NEON - harmony support]**
(Tonight, tonight)
**[PHOENIX]**
I'm done playing small, gonna shine so bright
**[NEON]**
(So bright, so bright)

### [Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - powerful lead]**
I'm gonna break the rules, break the rules
Do what I wanna do
**[NEON - soaring harmonies]**
(Break them down, break them down)
**[PHOENIX]**
Living like I got nothing to lose
Breaking through, breaking through
**[ALL - big harmony stack]**
No apologies, I'm bulletproof
I'm gonna break the rules tonight

### [Verse 2]
**[PHOENIX - lead vocal]**
They drew a line, said don't you cross
But I was never scared of getting lost
I'll take the road that no one dares
While they're stuck climbing boring stairs

**[REBEL - confident rap flow]**
Yeah, I color outside every line
Make mistakes and I'm doing fine
Their whispers just fuel my flame
Remember my name, remember my name

### [Pre-Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - building intensity]**
Watch me light it up, light it up tonight
**[NEON - harmony support]**
(Tonight, tonight)
**[PHOENIX]**
I'm done playing small, gonna shine so bright
**[NEON]**
(So bright, so bright)

### [Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - powerful lead]**
I'm gonna break the rules, break the rules
Do what I wanna do
**[NEON - soaring harmonies]**
(Break them down, break them down)
**[PHOENIX]**
Living like I got nothing to lose
Breaking through, breaking through
**[ALL - big harmony stack]**
No apologies, I'm bulletproof
I'm gonna break the rules tonight

### [Bridge]
**[REBEL - spoken/rap with attitude]**
They want us quiet, they want us small
But we're gonna rise and break down every wall
**[PHOENIX - building to climax]**
I'm not sorry for being me
This is my life, my symphony
**[NEON - ethereal harmonies underneath]**
(Break free, break free, break free)

### [Final Chorus - Key Change to F Minor]
**[PHOENIX - explosive delivery]**
I'm gonna break the rules, break the rules
Do what I wanna do
**[NEON - massive harmonies]**
(Break them down, break them down)
**[PHOENIX]**
Living like I got nothing to lose
Breaking through, breaking through
**[ALL - powerful unity]**
No apologies, I'm bulletproof
I'm gonna break the rules tonight

### [Outro]
**[PHOENIX - strong and resolute]**
Break the rules, break the rules
**[NEON - fading harmonies]**
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
**[REBEL - final spoken line]**
That's right, we make our own rules

## Song Analysis

**Persona Balance**: PHOENIX 60% (lead vocals, main narrative), NEON 25% (harmony support, anthemic lift), REBEL 15% (attitude injection, rap elements)

**Structure**: Intro → Verse → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Verse → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Bridge → Final Chorus (key change) → Outro

**Emotional Arc**: Starts with defiant confidence, builds through verses with rebellious energy, explodes in choruses with empowerment, peaks in the key-changed final chorus

**Hook Elements**: "Break the rules" repetition, "bulletproof" power word, pre-chorus build with echo harmonies

**Dynamic Contrast**: Verses have more space and attitude, pre-choruses build tension, choruses are massive and anthemic, bridge strips down before final explosion

## Production Tips

1. **Guitar Layers**: Use power chords in verses, add lead guitar riffs in choruses, create dynamic drops in pre-choruses
2. **Vocal Processing**: Add slight distortion to PHOENIX vocals for edge, heavy reverb on NEON harmonies for stadium feel
3. **Drum Programming**: Live drums with electronic enhancement, add hand claps in chorus for crowd participation feel
4. **Key Change**: Modulate up one semitone (E minor → F minor) in final chorus for extra energy
5. **Build Technique**: Strip down to bass and drums in bridge, then bring everything back with massive impact
6. **Reference Tracks**: Olivia Rodrigo's "good 4 u", Paramore's "Hard Times", Halsey's "Without Me"
