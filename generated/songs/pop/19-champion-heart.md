## Lyrics

```
[Power chord guitar intro with pounding drums]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(commanding)
I've got a champion heart!
(yeah!)
Been a fighter from the start!

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX rock delivery]
Knocked down seven times, stood up eight (stood up!)
Never let the losses determine my fate (never!)
Scars became my armor, pain became my fuel (fuel!)
Now I'm standing at the top, breaking every rule! (break it!)

They can throw their worst, I'll take the hit (bring it!)
Turn every setback into benefit (flip it!)
Champion mindset, that's how winners think (think!)
When they try to drown me, I refuse to sink! (swim!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(building)
(NEON: When the world tries to tear you apart...)
(PHOENIX: You fight back with a champion heart!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX powerful + NEON anthemic]
(explosive)
I'VE GOT A CHAMPION HE-E-EART! (NEON: champion heart!)
NEVER GIVING UP, I PLAY MY PA-A-ART! (NEON: play my part!)
THROUGH THE PAIN AND THE TEARS! (NEON: through the tears!)
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THROUGH THE YEARS! (NEON: all the years!)
WITH A CHAMPION HE-E-EART! (NEON: champion!)
THAT'S WHO WE A-A-ARE! (NEON: who we are!)
WE WERE BORN TO BE CHAMPIONS! (NEON: champions!)
BORN TO GO FAR! (NEON: go far!)

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX energetic]
Every mountain that I climbed made me tougher (tough!)
Every battle that I fought made me rougher (rough!)
Built this kingdom with my blood, sweat, and tears (built!)
Now I'm wearing victory like I've waited years! (crown!)

Champions aren't born, they're forged in the fire (fire!)
Every time I rise, I'm taking it higher (high!)
Gold medal mentality in my DNA (gold!)
When I set my mind to win, I find a way! (win!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: When the world tries to tear you apart...)
(PHOENIX: You fight back with a champion heart!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
I'VE GOT A CHAMPION HE-E-EART! (NEON: champion heart!)
NEVER GIVING UP, I PLAY MY PA-A-ART! (NEON: play my part!)
THROUGH THE PAIN AND THE TEARS! (NEON: through the tears!)
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THROUGH THE YEARS! (NEON: all the years!)
WITH A CHAMPION HE-E-EART! (NEON: champion!)
THAT'S WHO WE A-A-ARE! (NEON: who we are!)
WE WERE BORN TO BE CHAMPIONS! (NEON: champions!)
BORN TO GO FAR! (NEON: go far!)

[Bridge - PHOENIX rock power]
(guitar solo underneath)
(powerful)
THEY CAN'T BREAK ME! (NEON: unbreakable!)
CAN'T SHAKE ME! (NEON: unmovable!)
I'M A CHAMPION! (NEON: champion!)
THIS IS MY MOMENT! (NEON: this moment!)
WE'RE UNSTOPPABLE! (NEON: unstoppable!)
UNDENIABLE! (NEON: undeniable!)
CHAMPIONS FOREVER!
(BOTH: FOREVER!)

[Final Chorus - Both maximum energy]
(stadium anthem)
WE'VE GOT CHAMPION HE-E-EARTS! (unstoppable!)
NEVER GIVING UP, WE PLAY OUR PA-A-ART! (our part!)
THROUGH THE PAIN AND THE TEARS! (all the tears!)
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THROUGH THE YEARS! (fighting!)
WITH CHAMPION HE-E-EARTS! (champion!)
THAT'S WHO WE A-A-ARE! (who we are!)
WE WERE BORN TO BE CHAMPIONS!
BORN TO GO FAR!

[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]
(triumphant fade with guitar)
(PHOENIX: Champion heart...)
(NEON: ...we're champions...)
(BOTH: Born to go far!)
*final power chord*

## Why This Works

- **Pop rock fusion**: Combines melodic pop with rock energy
- **PHOENIX rock-pop delivery**: Powerful but melodic, not screaming
- **NEON anthemic backing**: Creates stadium sing-along atmosphere
- **135 BPM**: Fast enough for energy, slow enough for sing-alongs
- **Major key triumph**: Naturally victorious and uplifting
- **Champion theme**: Universal metaphor for perseverance
- **Negative descriptors**: "no acoustic, no ballad" keeps rock energy

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - guitar tone and rock intensity will vary
- Perfect for sports events, victory celebrations, gym workouts
- Guitar should be prominent but not metal-heavy
- PHOENIX should belt but maintain melodic quality
- Bridge guitar solo section adds rock authenticity
- NEON's anthemic backing creates crowd participation feel
- If too soft, emphasize "stadium drums" and "power chords"
