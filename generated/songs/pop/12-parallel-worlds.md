Create an atmospheric alt-pop track with shimmering guitars, ambient synth pads, and introspective vocals. Think Lorde meets LANY - emotionally intelligent with dreamy production. Use reverb-drenched guitars, subtle electronic beats, and layered ethereal vocals. The production should feel like looking through a kaleidoscope of possibilities, with multiple sonic dimensions and crystalline textures. Build from intimate verses to expansive, cinematic choruses.

**Instrumentation**: Clean electric guitar, ambient synths, programmed drums, bass, vocal harmonies, string pads
**Production Style**: Spacious, dreamy, layered with strategic use of silence and space
**Reference Artists**: Lorde, LANY, Phoebe Bridgers, The 1975

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
Sometimes I wonder in a different timeline
If we got it right, if we made it work somehow
Every choice we made split reality in two
There's a version of us that never broke down

**[Pre-Chorus]** *(NEON - 25%)*
In another universe I'm still holding your hand
Dancing in the kitchen like we always planned
Somewhere in the multiverse we never said goodbye
I can almost see it when I close my eyes

**[Chorus]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
In parallel worlds, we're still together
Where every mistake just made us better
I wonder if you feel me through the space between
In parallel worlds where love wins everything
Maybe we're happy in another scene
Parallel worlds haunting all my dreams

**[Verse 2]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
Every "what if" opens up another door
I pick the path that leads away from you, and now I'm torn
Quantum heartbreak spanning infinite realities
Somewhere we're strangers, somewhere we're meant to be

**[Pre-Chorus]** *(NEON - 25%)*
In another universe I'm still holding your hand
We got the timing right, everything went as planned
Somewhere in the multiverse we're watching our kids grow
I can almost touch it but I'll never know

**[Chorus]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
In parallel worlds, we're still together
Where every mistake just made us better
I wonder if you feel me through the space between
In parallel worlds where love wins everything
Maybe we're happy in another scene
Parallel worlds haunting all my dreams

**[Bridge]** *(REBEL - 15% + PHOENIX - 60%)*
Scientists say every moment branches out
Creating different versions of ourselves
If I could rip through the fabric of space and time
I'd find the world where we figured it out
But maybe I'm supposed to let you go
In this dimension, this is what I know

**[Final Chorus]** *(PHOENIX - 60% + NEON - 25%)*
In parallel worlds, we're still together
But in this one, I'm learning to do better
I'll stop searching through the space between
Accept the world that's real, not just what I've seen
Maybe I'm happy in this single scene
This parallel world is where I'm meant to be

**[Outro]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
Parallel worlds fading from my dreams
This one's enough, or so it seems
Parallel worlds, I'm letting go
This reality is all I'll ever know
