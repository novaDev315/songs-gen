## Lyrics
[Intro]
*Arpeggiated synths*
. . . . .

[Verse 1]
Riding through the neon glow
Where the crystal waters flow
Every beat a memory
Of the dreams we used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the pulse... the rhythm calls...

[Chorus]
CRYSTAL WAVES
Crashing on the shore
CRYSTAL WAVES
We're coming back for more
Underneath the stars tonight
Everything feels so right
Crystal waves...

[Verse 2]
Echoes from another time
Dancing in the pale moonlight
Colors blend and fade away
Into the endless night

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the pulse... the rhythm calls...

[Chorus]
CRYSTAL WAVES
Crashing on the shore
CRYSTAL WAVES
We're coming back for more
Underneath the stars tonight
Everything feels so right
Crystal waves...

[Outro]
*Synths fade out*
. . . . . . .
