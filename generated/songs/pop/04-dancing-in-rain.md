## Lyrics

**[Intro - PHOENIX ad-libs]**
*(Rain sounds, soft piano, building atmosphere)*
Let it pour... *(let it pour)*
Let it pour... *(yeah)*

**[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]**
Thunder rolling, storm clouds gathering
But I'm not running, I'm not shattering
Let the lightning strike, I'll stand my ground
Finding beauty in the chaos all around

**[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(PHOENIX leads)* When the world gets HEAVY and the sky turns grey
*(NEON harmonizes)* We'll find the JOY in the disarray
*(Together)* Let it RAIN, we're gonna be OKAY!

**[Chorus - PHOENIX lead, NEON harmonies]**
We're DANCING IN THE RAIN!
Washing away the PAIN!
Every drop's a NEW beginning!
Life is for the LIVING!
DANCING IN THE RAIN! *(rain, rain, rain)*
Going a little INSANE!
But that's what makes us HUMAN!
This storm is our REVOLUTION!
*(ooh-ooh-ooh, dancing, dancing)*

**[Verse 2 - NEON]**
Puddles forming, soaking through my shoes
But with you here, I got nothing to lose
Your smile shines brighter than the sun
Dancing with you, we've already won

**[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(PHOENIX leads)* When the world gets HEAVY and the sky turns grey
*(NEON harmonizes)* We'll find the JOY in the disarray
*(Together)* Let it RAIN, we're gonna be OKAY!

**[Chorus - ALL]**
We're DANCING IN THE RAIN!
Washing away the PAIN!
Every drop's a NEW beginning!
Life is for the LIVING!
DANCING IN THE RAIN! *(rain, rain, rain)*
Going a little INSANE!
But that's what makes us HUMAN!
This storm is our REVOLUTION!
*(ooh-ooh-ooh, dancing, dancing)*

**[Rap Break - REBEL]**
*(Beat intensifies, rain percussion)*
Yeah! Life ain't perfect, that's a FACT
But we bounce BACK, that's how we act
When it POURS, we don't hide away
We go HARD, turn night to day
Umbrella? NAH, we don't need that
Feel the RAIN, that's where it's at
Storm coming? Bring it ON
We'll be dancing 'til the DAWN!

**[Bridge - NEON emotional]**
*(Music opens up, atmospheric)*
In the eye of the storm *(storm)*
We found where we belong *(belong)*
Every raindrop SINGS our song
We were RIGHT, they were WRONG *(wrong)*
To hide away from LIFE *(life)*
From the beautiful STRIFE *(strife)*
We're alive, we're FREE
Dancing wild and CAREFREE!

**[Final Chorus - ALL maximum energy]**
We're DANCING IN THE RAIN! *(IN THE RAIN!)*
Washing away the PAIN! *(ALL THE PAIN!)*
Every drop's a NEW beginning! *(NEW BEGINNING!)*
Life is for the LIVING! *(FOR THE LIVING!)*
DANCING IN THE RAIN! *(rain, rain, rain)*
Going a little INSANE! *(IT'S INSANE!)*
But that's what makes us HUMAN! *(SO HUMAN!)*
This storm is our REVOLUTION!
We're DANCING, DANCING, DANCING! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*

**[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(Rain continues, peaceful piano)*
*(PHOENIX)* Dancing in the rain... *(rain)*
*(NEON)* Finding joy in pain...
*(Together)* Let it pour... *(let it pour)*
We want more... *(yeah, yeah, yeah)*

## Generation Tips

1. **Vocal Recording**:
   - PHOENIX: Powerful and defiant; joyful despite circumstances
   - NEON: Tender but hopeful; bridge should soar emotionally
   - REBEL: Confident and rebellious; match the storm's intensity

2. **Production Focus**:
   - Layer rain sounds throughout (not just intro/outro)
   - Use reverb to create atmospheric, spacious feel
   - Thunder hits on beat for dramatic moments
   - Keep production intimate (bedroom pop aesthetic) until chorus expands

3. **Mix Priorities**:
   - Rain sounds should be present but not overwhelming
   - Vocals need clarity through atmospheric production
   - Bridge should feel like the sky opening up
   - Final chorus needs maximum joy and energy

4. **Key Moments**:
   - Extended "RAIN" with vocal runs and rain sound effects
   - Bridge emotional peak with soaring harmonies
   - "REVOLUTION" should feel triumphant and liberating
   - Outro peaceful resolution—rain becomes soothing, not threatening
