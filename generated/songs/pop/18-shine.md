## Lyrics

```
[Gentle piano intro]

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX soft]
(intimate)
In the darkness, I found my light... (found my light...)
Through the struggle, I learned to fight... (learned to fight...)
Every shadow made me stronger than before... (before...)
Now I'm ready to become so much more... (so much more...)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX building + NEON soft]
(gaining confidence)
I was hiding, but now I'm breaking free-ee...
All this time, the power was in me-ee...

[Chorus - PHOENIX powerful + NEON harmonies]
(full production kicks in)
NOW I SHI-I-INE! (NEON: shine so bright!)
BRIGHTER THAN THE STA-A-ARS TONIGHT! (NEON: stars tonight!)
I SHI-I-INE! (NEON: can't dim my light!)
NOTHING'S GONNA HOLD ME BACK THIS TIME! (NEON: not this time!)
From the ashes, I rise... (NEON: I rise...)
Breaking through the lies... (NEON: the lies...)
NOW I SHI-I-INE! (NEON: shine!)
THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE! (NEON: my time!)

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX emotional]
(building energy)
I was broken, pieced myself together, yeah... (together...)
Made of diamonds formed under pressure, yeah... (pressure...)
Every crack became a place the light shines through... (shines through...)
Now I'm glowing with a truth that feels brand new... (brand new...)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON building]
(NEON: You were hiding, but now you're breaking free-ee...)
(PHOENIX: All this time, the power was in me-ee!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
NOW I SHI-I-INE! (NEON: shine so bright!)
BRIGHTER THAN THE STA-A-ARS TONIGHT! (NEON: stars tonight!)
I SHI-I-INE! (NEON: can't dim my light!)
NOTHING'S GONNA HOLD ME BACK THIS TIME! (NEON: not this time!)
From the ashes, I rise... (NEON: I rise...)
Breaking through the lies... (NEON: the lies...)
NOW I SHI-I-INE! (NEON: shine!)
THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE! (NEON: my time!)

[Bridge - PHOENIX vulnerable to powerful]
(emotional peak)
(soft at first)
I was dim... I was fading...
(NEON: ...you were waiting...)
(building)
Now I'm BRIGHT! Now I'm BLAZING!
(NEON: ...so amazing...)
(powerful)
WATCH ME GLOW! WATCH ME RISE!
(BOTH: LIGHTING UP THE SKIES!)

[Final Chorus - Both maximum emotion]
(explosive and emotional)
NOW WE SHI-I-INE! (brighter than ever!)
BRIGHTER THAN THE STA-A-ARS TONIGHT! (so bright!)
WE SHI-I-INE! (our light!)
NOTHING'S GONNA HOLD US BACK THIS TIME! (never!)
From the ashes, we rise! (we rise!)
Breaking through the lies! (the lies!)
NOW WE SHI-I-INE! (we shine!)
THIS IS OUR TIME TO SHINE!

[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]
(gentle return to piano)
(PHOENIX: Shi-i-ine...)
(NEON: ...we shine...)
(PHOENIX: This is my time...)
(BOTH: ...to shine...)
*final piano chord*

## Why This Works

- **Dynamic journey**: Soft vulnerable intro builds to powerful chorus
- **PHOENIX emotional range**: Showcases vulnerability AND power
- **NEON warm support**: Adds depth without overpowering emotional delivery
- **Piano-driven foundation**: Creates intimate beginning for authentic build
- **Major key with emotional depth**: Hopeful but earned through struggle
- **120 BPM**: Moderate tempo allows for emotional expression
- **Negative descriptors**: "no trap, no heavy bass" keeps focus on vocal journey

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - emotional delivery varies significantly
- Perfect for overcoming playlists, empowerment moments, self-discovery
- Verse 1 should feel intimate and piano-focused
- Chorus should explode with full production (synths, drums, bass)
- Bridge vulnerability-to-power arc is crucial for impact
- PHOENIX's vocal journey from soft to powerful tells the story
- If Suno doesn't capture dynamic range, emphasize "ballad build" in style
