## Lyrics

### [Intro]
**[REBEL - sassy spoken]**
Oh, you thought I'd fall apart?
**[PHOENIX - confident]**
Watch me now

### [Verse 1]
**[PHOENIX - clear, confident delivery]**
Woke up this morning feeling brand new
Threw out the pictures, everything of you
Mirror's showing someone I forgot I knew
Finally seeing what I'm capable to do

**[PHOENIX - continuing]**
No more crying over yesterday
No more holding on to the pain
I'm stepping out in my own light
Yeah, I'm gonna be just fine

### [Pre-Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - building energy]**
Used to think I needed you to breathe
**[NEON - supportive harmony]**
(Needed you, needed you)
**[PHOENIX]**
Now I'm standing on my own two feet
**[NEON]**
(On my own, on my own)
**[REBEL - ad-lib]**
Yeah, that's right!

### [Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - powerful, joyful]**
I'm better off, better off without you
**[NEON - bright harmonies]**
(So much better, so much better)
**[PHOENIX]**
I'm better off, better off, it's true
Finally seeing what I'm meant to do
**[ALL - unified celebration]**
I'm better off, better off
And I've never felt more alive
**[PHOENIX - triumphant]**
I'm better off without you by my side

### [Verse 2]
**[PHOENIX - sassy delivery]**
You kept me small inside your shadow
But now I'm dancing on my own tempo
I'm the main character of my story
Done being sorry, living in my glory

**[REBEL - rhythmic attitude]**
Yeah, I level up, you stay the same
Playing victim in your little game
I'm too busy living my best life
Shining brighter than the city lights

### [Pre-Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - building energy]**
Used to think I needed you to breathe
**[NEON - supportive harmony]**
(Needed you, needed you)
**[PHOENIX]**
Now I'm standing on my own two feet
**[NEON]**
(On my own, on my own)
**[REBEL - ad-lib]**
Watch me fly!

### [Chorus]
**[PHOENIX - powerful, joyful]**
I'm better off, better off without you
**[NEON - bright harmonies]**
(So much better, so much better)
**[PHOENIX]**
I'm better off, better off, it's true
Finally seeing what I'm meant to do
**[ALL - unified celebration]**
I'm better off, better off
And I've never felt more alive
**[PHOENIX - triumphant]**
I'm better off without you by my side

### [Bridge - Break Down]
**[PHOENIX - stripped, emotional honesty]**
I'm not gonna lie, it hurt at first
Thought I'd never make it through the worst
**[NEON - building support]**
(Make it through, make it through)
**[PHOENIX - strength building]**
But now I'm stronger than I've ever been
This is where my real life begins

**[REBEL - spoken with fire]**
I don't need your validation
I'm my own celebration
**[ALL - building to explosion]**
Better, better, better off!

### [Final Chorus - Full Production]
**[PHOENIX - explosive delivery]**
I'm better off, better off without you
**[NEON - massive harmonies]**
(So much better, so much better now)
**[PHOENIX]**
I'm better off, better off, it's true
Finally seeing what I'm meant to do
**[ALL - powerful unity]**
I'm better off, better off
And I've never felt more alive
**[PHOENIX - triumphant final line]**
I'm so much better off without you by my side

### [Outro]
**[PHOENIX - confident and free]**
Better off, better off
**[NEON - joyful harmonies]**
(Never looking back, never looking back)
**[REBEL - final ad-lib]**
Yeah, I'm better off!
**[PHOENIX - spoken, satisfied]**
So much better

## Song Analysis

**Persona Balance**: PHOENIX 60% (confident lead, main narrative), NEON 25% (celebratory harmonies, emotional support), REBEL 15% (sassy attitude, ad-libs)

**Structure**: Intro → Verse → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Verse → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Bridge (breakdown/build) → Final Chorus → Outro

**Emotional Arc**: Starts with confident awakening, builds through verses with self-discovery, explodes in choruses with celebration, moment of vulnerability in bridge before triumphant finale

**Hook Elements**: "Better off" repetition with rhythmic emphasis, "never felt more alive" emotional peak, pre-chorus contrast of dependency to independence

**Dynamic Contrast**: Verses have forward momentum, pre-choruses build tension with harmony layers, choruses are full and celebratory, bridge strips down before final explosion
