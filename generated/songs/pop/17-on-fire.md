## Lyrics

```
[Electric guitar riff with pounding drums]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(powerful)
Feel the heat, feel the fire!
(yeah!)
Taking it higher and higher!

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
Lightning in my veins, I'm electric tonight (electric!)
Everything I touch turns to dynamite (boom!)
Can't contain this energy, it's overflowing (flowing!)
Watch me light up everything, I'm glowing! (glow!)

Nothing gonna slow me down, I'm in the zone (zone!)
This momentum building like a rolling stone (roll!)
Temperature rising, yeah, I'm breaking records (hot!)
This fire inside me can't be measured! (can't!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(building)
(NEON: Feel it burning up inside...)
(PHOENIX: Can't control this wild ride!)
(NEON: We're about to ignite...)
(BOTH: Tonight!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX explosive + NEON backing]
I'M ON FI-I-IRE! (NEON: fire, fire!)
BURNING BRIGHTER THAN THE SU-U-UN! (NEON: than the sun!)
I'M ON FI-I-IRE! (NEON: higher, higher!)
AND I'M NEVER GONNA BE UNDONE! (NEON: never done!)
Feel the flames! (NEON: feel the flames!)
I'm untamed! (NEON: untamed!)
NOTHING'S GONNA STOP THIS BLAZE!
I'M ON FI-I-IRE! (NEON: fire!)
LIGHTING UP THE SKY TODAY! (NEON: today!)

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX fast]
Burning through obstacles like paper, I'm a force (force!)
Running my own race, staying on my course (my course!)
Every step I take leaves sparks in my wake (sparks!)
This inferno in my soul, you can't fake! (nah!)

Hotter than July, yeah, I'm sizzling (hot!)
This passion in my heart keeps drizzling (pour!)
Into everything I do, I'm blazing trails (blaze!)
When I set my mind to it, I never fail! (never!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: Feel it burning up inside...)
(PHOENIX: Can't control this wild ride!)
(NEON: We're about to ignite...)
(BOTH: Tonight!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
I'M ON FI-I-IRE! (NEON: fire, fire!)
BURNING BRIGHTER THAN THE SU-U-UN! (NEON: than the sun!)
I'M ON FI-I-IRE! (NEON: higher, higher!)
AND I'M NEVER GONNA BE UNDONE! (NEON: never done!)
Feel the flames! (NEON: feel the flames!)
I'm untamed! (NEON: untamed!)
NOTHING'S GONNA STOP THIS BLAZE!
I'M ON FI-I-IRE! (NEON: fire!)
LIGHTING UP THE SKY TODAY! (NEON: today!)

[Bridge - PHOENIX powerful with NEON]
(explosive energy)
(PHOENIX: WATCH ME BURN! WATCH ME RISE!)
(NEON: She's on fire!)
(PHOENIX: WATCH ME SOAR ACROSS THE SKIES!)
(NEON: Higher and higher!)
(PHOENIX: CAN'T PUT OUT THIS FLAME!)
(BOTH: WE'LL NEVER BE THE SAME!)

[Final Chorus - Both maximum energy]
(explosive)
WE'RE ON FI-I-IRE! (burning bright!)
BURNING BRIGHTER THAN THE SU-U-UN! (so bright!)
WE'RE ON FI-I-IRE! (can't deny!)
AND WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE UNDONE! (never!)
Feel the flames! (blazing!)
We're untamed! (raging!)
NOTHING'S GONNA STOP THIS BLAZE!
WE'RE ON FI-I-IRE!
LIGHTING UP THE WORLD TODAY!

[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]
(fade with guitar and drums)
(PHOENIX: On fire... on fire...)
(NEON: ...burning bright...)
(BOTH: We're on fire tonight!)

## Why This Works

- **130 BPM uptempo**: Creates urgent, energetic momentum
- **PHOENIX commanding lead**: Perfect for high-energy delivery
- **NEON backing support**: Adds fullness without complexity
- **Electric guitars + four-on-the-floor**: Classic uptempo pop foundation
- **Fire metaphor**: Visceral, relatable symbol of unstoppable energy
- **No slow sections**: Maintains energy from start to finish
- **Negative descriptors**: "no ballad, no slow sections" keeps tempo consistent

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - energy levels may vary significantly
- Perfect for workout playlists, party mixes, high-energy events
- PHOENIX should maintain powerful delivery throughout
- Guitar riff should be prominent but not overwhelm vocals
- Bridge creates explosive peak for final chorus
- If Suno adds slow sections, regenerate with stronger tempo emphasis
