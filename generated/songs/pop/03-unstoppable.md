## Lyrics
```
[Uplifting piano intro with building drums]

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
They tried to clip my wings before I learned to fly (fly)
Told me I was dreaming, told me not to try (not to try)
But every single setback made me stronger, yeah (stronger)
Now I'm breaking through the ceiling, can't be held down any longer!

[Pre-Chorus - NEON]
(smooth harmonies)
I've been waiting for this moment all my life...
Now I'm ready, gonna shine so bright...

[Chorus - PHOENIX powerful + NEON harmonies]
(explosive)
I'M UNSTO-O-OPPABLE! (NEON: unstoppable!)
NOTHING'S GONNA BRING ME DO-O-OWN! (NEON: bring me down!)
I'M UNSTO-O-OPPABLE! (NEON: yeah, yeah, yeah!)
WATCH ME CLAIM MY CROWN! (NEON: claim my crown!)

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
Every mountain that I climbed just made me braver, yeah (braver)
Every storm I weathered turned me to a fighter (fighter)
Now I'm standing on the summit, wind beneath my wings (soaring!)
Nothing's im-po-o-ssible, I can do anything!

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX harmony]
(NEON: We've been waiting for this moment all our lives...)
(PHOENIX: Now we're ready, gonna shine so bright!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
I'M UNSTO-O-OPPABLE! (NEON: unstoppable!)
NOTHING'S GONNA BRING ME DO-O-OWN! (NEON: bring me down!)
I'M UNSTO-O-OPPABLE! (NEON: yeah, yeah, yeah!)
WATCH ME CLAIM MY CROWN! (NEON: claim my crown!)

[Bridge - PHOENIX builds + NEON supports]
(emotional peak)
(PHOENIX: I was broken...)
(NEON: ...now I'm whole...)
(PHOENIX: I was silent...)
(NEON: ...now I'm bold...)
(PHOENIX: I WAS FALLING...)
(BOTH: NOW I'M SO-O-OARING!)

[Final Chorus - Both powerful]
(stadium energy)
WE'RE UNSTO-O-OPPABLE! (yeah!)
NOTHING'S GONNA BRING US DO-O-OWN! (never!)
WE'RE UNSTO-O-OPPABLE! (unstoppable!)
WATCH US CLAIM OUR CROWN!

[Post-Chorus - NEON]
(triumphant)
Can't stop us now... (can't stop us now)
Can't stop us now... (we're unstoppable)
Can't stop us now!

[Outro - Both]
(drums fade with piano)
(PHOENIX: Unstoppable...)
(NEON: ...forever...)
*final triumphant chord*

## Why This Works
- **PHOENIX powerhouse vocals**: Perfect for empowerment anthem
- **NEON harmonies**: Adds depth without competing for lead
- **NO rap personas**: This is pure pop, so REBEL/CYPHER don't fit
- **Stadium production**: Glossy, uplifting, radio-ready
- **Major key + 128 BPM**: Classic anthemic power pop tempo
- **Negative descriptors**: "no trap, no heavy bass" keeps it pure pop

## Generation Tips
- Generate 6+ variations - belt notes may vary significantly
- PHOENIX should dominate the mix on choruses
- NEON provides support, not competition
- The bridge builds to explosive final chorus
