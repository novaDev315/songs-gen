## Lyrics
[Intro]
*soft synth pad*
. . . . . .

[Verse 1]
Walking through the neon glow
City lights put on a show
Every shadow tells a story
Of the love we used to know...

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it in the air tonight?
Stars are falling, burning bright
Take my hand, don't let me go
Into the dark where dreamers flow...

[Chorus]
MIDNIGHT DREAMS are calling out to me
Lo-o-ost in the rhythm, finally free!
Dancing through the night until the dawn
MIDNIGHT DREAMS... carry me on!

[Verse 2]
Memories like photographs
Fading in the aftermath
But the beat keeps pushing forward
Down this neon-lit path...

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it in the air tonight?
Stars are falling, burning BRIGHT!
Take my hand, don't let me go
Into the dark where dreamers flow...

[Chorus]
MIDNIGHT DREAMS are calling out to me
Lo-o-ost in the rhythm, finally free!
Dancing through the night until the dawn
MIDNIGHT DREAMS... carry me on!

[Bridge]
(whispered) Let the music take control...
Feel the beat inside your soul...
(building) We are INFINITE tonight!
We are BURNING with the light!

[Final Chorus]
MIDNIGHT DREAMS ARE CALLING OUT TO ME!
Lo-o-ost in the rhythm, FINALLY FREE!
DANCING THROUGH THE NIGHT UNTIL THE DAWN!
MIDNIGHT DREAMS... (echo) midnight dreams...
CARRY ME ON!

[Outro]
*synth fadeout*
. . . carry me on . . .
. . . . . .
