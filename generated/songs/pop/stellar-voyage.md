## Lyrics
[Intro]
*Orchestra swells*
. . . . .

[Verse 1]
Beyond the clouds where starlight gleams
I chase the echoes of my dreams
Through galaxies of hope and light
I'll find my way through endless night

[Pre-Chorus]
Every star... was once a wish
Every dream... too big to miss

[Chorus]
STELLAR VOYAGE
Taking flight!
STELLAR VOYAGE
Through the night!
We are boundless, we are free
Sailing through infinity
STELLAR VOYAGE

[Verse 2]
The universe unfolds its arms
A million suns, a million charms
Each planet holds a story new
Of all the things we're meant to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Every star... was once a wish
Every dream... too big to miss

[Chorus]
STELLAR VOYAGE
Taking flight!
STELLAR VOYAGE
Through the night!
We are boundless, we are free
Sailing through infinity
STELLAR VOYAGE

[Bridge]
(building intensity)
We rise... we SOAR!
Beyond what we've known before-ore-ore!

[Final Chorus]
STELLAR VOYAGE!
TAKING FLIGHT!
STELLAR VOYAGE!
THROUGH THE NIGHT!
We are boundless, WE ARE FREE!
Sailing through infinity
STELLAR VOYAGE...

[Outro]
*Orchestra fades to soft piano*
. . . . . . .
