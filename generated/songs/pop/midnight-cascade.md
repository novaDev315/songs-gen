## Lyrics
[Intro]
*Soft synth pads*
. . . . .

[Verse 1]
Stars are falling through the night
Dancing on the water's edge
Every ripple holds the light
Of the dreams we dare to pledge

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel it rising up inside
Like a wave I cannot hide...

[Chorus]
MIDNIGHT CASCADE
Washing over me-e-e
MIDNIGHT CASCADE
Setting spirits free
When the world fades to grey
Let the music take us away
MIDNIGHT CASCADE

[Verse 2]
Shadows blend with silver haze
Heartbeats sync to silent hymns
Lost in this electric maze
Where the night forever swims

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel it rising up inside
Like a wave I cannot hide...

[Chorus]
MIDNIGHT CASCADE
Washing over me-e-e
MIDNIGHT CASCADE
Setting spirits free
When the world fades to grey
Let the music take us away
MIDNIGHT CASCADE

[Bridge]
(softer, whispered)
Let go... let flow...
The current knows the way to go-o-o

[Final Chorus]
MIDNIGHT CASCADE!
WASHING OVER ME!
MIDNIGHT CASCADE!
SETTING SPIRITS FREE!
When the world fades to grey
Let the music take us away
MIDNIGHT CASCADE...

[Outro]
*Synth pads fade*
. . . . . . .
