## Verse 1
Met you under the Milky Way
City lights a million miles away
You pointed out Cassiopeia
I never knew the sky could feel this way

Your hand in mine, a binary star system
Two bodies orbiting with perfect rhythm
Light years couldn't measure this distance
Or the gravity between our existence

## Pre-Chorus
Count the stars, count the ways
That you illuminate my days
We're written in the cosmic dust
In the universe we trust

## Chorus
Give me a constellation kiss
Map your love across my lips
Every touch a supernova bliss
Give me a constellation kiss

We're astronomy in the dark
Your love leaves a meteor mark
Burning bright, we can't resist
Give me a constellation kiss

## Verse 2
Orion's belt around your waist
Big Dipper freckles on your face
Northern lights dance in your eyes
You're my favorite part of the night sky

We're stardust, baby, atoms combined
Elements formed when ancient stars died
We're millions of years in the making
And I'd wait forever, no mistaking

## Pre-Chorus
Count the stars, count the ways
That you illuminate my days
We're written in the cosmic dust
In the universe we trust

## Chorus
Give me a constellation kiss
Map your love across my lips
Every touch a supernova bliss
Give me a constellation kiss

We're astronomy in the dark
Your love leaves a meteor mark
Burning bright, we can't resist
Give me a constellation kiss

## Bridge
(Soft, intimate vocals over ambient soundscape)
If the sun explodes tomorrow
And we're floating in the void
I'd find you in the darkness
By your starlight, I'd be pulled

Across the endless expanse
We're cosmically connected
Every galaxy between us
Couldn't leave us unaffected

(Building with shimmering synths)
We're infinite, we're infinite
Written in the stars, so intimate
We're infinite, we're infinite
This moment is our planet

## Final Chorus
Give me a constellation kiss
Map your love across my lips
Every touch a supernova bliss
Give me a constellation kiss

We're astronomy in the dark
Your love leaves a meteor mark
Burning bright, we can't resist
Give me a constellation kiss

(Extended outro)
Give me that cosmic, cosmic kiss
Give me that stellar, stellar bliss
Give me that constellation
That celestial sensation
Give me a constellation kiss

## Outro
(Whispered, intimate)
Under the stars, under the moon
Me and you, me and you
Universe in bloom
Me and you...

(Fading with twinkling sounds and distant humming)

**Production Notes**:
- Lo-fi bedroom pop aesthetic with warm, intimate sound
- Acoustic guitar fingerpicking as foundation
- Soft, breathy vocals with minimal processing
- Layered ambient synths creating spacey atmosphere
- Subtle vinyl crackle and tape hiss for texture
- Gentle drum machine with brush snare sounds
- Dreamy reverb and tape delay throughout
- Bridge features ethereal pad swells and distant choir
- Use of space sounds (NASA recordings, synthesized cosmic ambience)
- Twinkly music box or kalimba accents
- Bass line warm and round, not aggressive
- Vocal harmonies loose and natural, slightly out of time
- Overall mix intentionally imperfect, bedroom-recorded quality
- Outro fades naturally like falling asleep under stars
- Dynamic range favors intimacy over loudness
- Consider vinyl record simulation for nostalgic cosmic feel
