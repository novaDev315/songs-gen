## Lyrics

[Soaring synth intro with building drums]

[Intro - NEON]
(hopeful)
Dream big... dream bi-i-ig...
(yeah!)

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
They said keep your head down, stay inside the lines (stay down)
But I was born to break the rules and redesign (break free!)
Every limit that they set became a challenge, yeah (challenge!)
Now I'm reaching for the stars, no balance, yeah! (reach!)

I refuse to settle for the ordinary life (nah!)
I'm extraordinary, watch me take this flight (fly!)
Vision so clear, got my eyes on the horizon (see it!)
Every dream I chase, I catch, no compromising! (catch!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON]
(building energy)
Don't let them tell you what you can't achi-i-ieve...
The only limits are the ones we be-lie-eve...

[Chorus - PHOENIX powerful + NEON harmonies]
(explosive)
DREAM BI-I-IG! (NEON: dream bigger!)
NO LIMITS TO WHAT WE CAN DO-O-O! (NEON: what we can do!)
DREAM BI-I-IG! (NEON: reach higher!)
THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR YO-O-OU! (NEON: waiting for you!)
Make it happen, take action! (NEON: take action!)
Turn your vision into reality! (NEON: reality!)
DREAM BI-I-IG! (NEON: dream big!)
THAT'S WHO WE'RE MEANT TO BE! (NEON: meant to be!)

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
Started with a vision in my mind, so vivid (vivid!)
Now I'm living proof that if you dream, you did it (proof!)
Every setback was a setup for a comeback (back!)
Now I'm running to my future on a fast track! (zoom!)

They can doubt me all they want, I'm still believing (believe!)
My ambition's like a fire, always breathing (fire!)
Dreaming bigger than the sky, that's my mission (sky!)
Now I'm turning every dream into fruition! (turn it!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: Don't let them tell you what you can't achi-i-ieve...)
(PHOENIX: The only limits are the ones we believe!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
DREAM BI-I-IG! (NEON: dream bigger!)
NO LIMITS TO WHAT WE CAN DO-O-O! (NEON: what we can do!)
DREAM BI-I-IG! (NEON: reach higher!)
THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR YO-O-OU! (NEON: waiting for you!)
Make it happen, take action! (NEON: take action!)
Turn your vision into reality! (NEON: reality!)
DREAM BI-I-IG! (NEON: dream big!)
THAT'S WHO WE'RE MEANT TO BE! (NEON: meant to be!)

[Bridge - PHOENIX builds with NEON support]
(emotional peak)
(PHOENIX: If you can see it in your mind...)
(NEON: ...you can hold it in your hands...)
(PHOENIX: If you believe and take your time...)
(NEON: ...you can make it, yes you can!)
(PHOENIX: WE CAN FLY!)
(NEON: We can soar!)
(BOTH: NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE ANYMORE!)

[Final Chorus - Both powerful]
(stadium energy)
DREAM BI-I-IG! (bigger than before!)
NO LIMITS TO WHAT WE CAN DO-O-O! (we can do anything!)
DREAM BI-I-IG! (reach for the sky!)
THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR YO-O-OU! (it's waiting!)
Make it happen! (make it real!)
Take action! (take it now!)
Turn your vision into reality!
DREAM BI-I-IG!
THAT'S WHO WE'RE MEANT TO BE!

[Outro - NEON + PHOENIX]
(triumphant fade)
(PHOENIX: Dream bi-i-ig...)
(NEON: ...no limits...)
(BOTH: That's who we're meant to be!)
*final synth swell*
