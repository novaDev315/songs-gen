## Verse 1
Wake up, check my phone
Same thoughts, I'm not alone (I'm not alone, not alone, not alone)
Scroll down, spiral out
What's this all about? (about, about, about, about)

Mirror, mirror in my head
Repeat everything you said (everything you said, said, said)
Round and round the same old fears
Been stuck inside for years (for years, years, years, years)

## Pre-Chorus
Bounce, bounce, bounce it back
Thoughts ricochet, under attack
Sound, sound, sound collides
Can't escape what's inside

## Chorus
Living in an echo chamber
Every thought becomes a stranger
Amplified until it's danger
Echo, echo chamber
(Chamber, chamber, chamber, chamber)

Feedback loop is getting louder
Voices mixing, thoughts get clouder
Can't remember what was first now
Echo, echo chamber
(Chamber, chamber, chamber, chamber)

## Verse 2
Algorithm knows my brain
Feeds me back my own pain (my own pain, pain, pain, pain)
Confirmation everywhere
Nobody seems to care (seems to care, care, care, care)

Trapped inside this sonic room
Frequencies consume (consume, consume, consume, consume)
Everyone agrees with me
But something's wrong, can't you see? (can't you see, see, see, see)

## Pre-Chorus
Bounce, bounce, bounce it back
Thoughts ricochet, under attack
Sound, sound, sound collides
Can't escape what's inside

## Chorus
Living in an echo chamber
Every thought becomes a stranger
Amplified until it's danger
Echo, echo chamber
(Chamber, chamber, chamber, chamber)

Feedback loop is getting louder
Voices mixing, thoughts get clouder
Can't remember what was first now
Echo, echo chamber
(Chamber, chamber, chamber, chamber)

## Bridge
(Glitchy, stuttering breakdown)
Break the-break the-break the walls
Break the-break the-break it all
Need to-need to-need to breathe
Need to-need to-need to leave

(Pitch-shifted vocals cascading)
Echo, echo, echo, echo
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Echo, echo, echo, echo
Let go, let go, let go

(Momentary silence)

(Whispered)
What if I'm wrong?
What if I'm wrong?
What if I'm wrong?

(Explosion of sound)

## Final Chorus
Breaking through this echo chamber
Every thought I'll rearrange here
Turn the volume down from danger
No more echo chamber
(Chamber, chamber, chamber, chamber)

Feedback loop, I'll cut the power
Find my voice inside the clutter
I'll remember what was first now
Exit the echo chamber
(Chamber, chamber, chamber, chamber)

## Outro
(Rapid-fire, overlapping vocals)
Out, out, out, out
Shout, shout, shout, shout
Out, out, out, out
No doubt, doubt, doubt, doubt

(Vocals fragment and deconstruct)
Ech-ech-ech-echo
Ch-ch-ch-chamber
N-n-n-no more
F-f-f-free now

(Sudden cut to silence, then single clean vocal)
...finally quiet.

**Production Notes**:
- Extremely fast-paced with aggressive energy
- Heavy use of vocal manipulation (pitch shifting, time stretching, chopping)
- Distorted 808s and blown-out bass
- Glitchy percussion with rapid hi-hat rolls
- Harsh sidechain compression creating pumping effect
- Multiple vocal layers singing in slight offset creating dissonance
- Use of audio feedback as musical element
- Reverb and delay pushed to extremes for claustrophobic sound
- Bridge features controlled chaos with elements dropping in and out erratically
- Vocal effects include vocoder, bitcrusher, and extreme autotune
- Intentional digital artifacts and clipping for aesthetic
- Dynamic contrast between overwhelming density and sudden emptiness
- Outro progressively deconstructs the song elements
- Final moment of silence after chaos provides cathartic release
