## Verse 1
They said I'd never make it off the ground
Too much weight, too many doubts holding me down
But I've been calculating my escape velocity
Newton's apple falling up, new reality

Feet on the pavement, head in the clouds
Tired of listening to the logical crowd
There's a force inside me, stronger than Earth's pull
I'm breaking through the atmosphere, beautiful

## Pre-Chorus
9.8 meters per second
That's the speed of falling
But I'm done with descending
I hear the sky calling

## Chorus
I defied gravity, left it behind
Floating through space, redefining time
No more chains, no more ground beneath my feet
I'm dancing on the moon, feeling so complete
I defied gravity, watch me soar
Higher than I've ever been before
They said impossible, I said watch me fly
I defied gravity, touching the sky

## Verse 2
Weightless in the void, spinning through the stars
All the rules I learned on Earth seem so bizarre
Up is down and down is up when you're this high
Physics can't explain the feeling when you try

Every limit they imposed was just a cage
Written by someone else on someone else's page
I'm rewriting science with my trajectory
Orbiting my own truth, finally free

## Pre-Chorus
9.8 meters per second
That's the speed of falling
But I'm done with descending
I hear the sky calling

## Chorus
I defied gravity, left it behind
Floating through space, redefining time
No more chains, no more ground beneath my feet
I'm dancing on the moon, feeling so complete
I defied gravity, watch me soar
Higher than I've ever been before
They said impossible, I said watch me fly
I defied gravity, touching the sky

## Bridge
(Spoken/whispered with echo effects)
Mass times acceleration
Equals force of liberation
Energy cannot be destroyed
Only transformed into the void

(Building vocals)
I'm anti-gravity, anomaly
Breaking every natural law they taught to me
Centrifugal, radical
This is my miracle

(Instrumental section with glitchy, futuristic synths and vocal chops)

Zero G, zero G, I'm floating free
Zero G, zero G, come fly with me

## Final Chorus
I defied gravity, left it behind
Floating through space, redefining time
No more chains, no more ground beneath my feet
I'm dancing on the moon, feeling so complete

We defied gravity, watch us soar
Higher than we've ever been before
They said impossible, we said watch us fly
We defied gravity, touching the sky

## Outro
(Atmospheric, with layered vocals)
Lift off, lift off, into the unknown
Lift off, lift off, I'm not alone
Lift off, lift off, gravity defied
Lift off, lift off, on this cosmic ride

(Fading with spacey synths and distant radio transmission sounds)

**Production Notes**:
- Fast-paced with energetic future bass influences
- Glitchy vocal chops and pitch-shifted samples
- Heavy sidechain compression for pumping effect
- Bright, shimmering synth leads with plenty of movement
- Sub-bass drops that hit hard on key moments
- Atmospheric pads creating sense of space and vastness
- White noise risers and downshifters for transitions
- Bridge features experimental sound design (reversed audio, granular synthesis)
- Vocal processing with autotune and vocoder effects
- Outro gradually reduces elements, leaving ethereal ambience
