## Lyrics

**[Intro - Instrumental]**
*(Shimmering synths, beach waves, whistling melody)*

**[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]**
Barefoot on the boardwalk, sand between my toes
Golden hour kisses, everybody knows
We're writing our names in the sunset sky
Making memories that'll never die

**[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(PHOENIX leads)* Time stops when you're HERE with me
*(NEON harmonizes)* Frozen in this SWEET eternity
*(Together)* We got forever in a SINGLE day!

**[Chorus - PHOENIX lead, NEON harmonies]**
Let's make this SUMMER LAST FOREVER!
Dancing through the STORMY weather!
Hearts on FIRE, we're burning BRIGHT!
Living like we'll NEVER see the NIGHT!
SUMMER FOREVEEEER! *(yeah-yeah-yeah)*
These GOLDEN days, we'll stay TOGETHER!
SUMMER FOREVEEEER! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*

**[Verse 2 - RAP/REBEL]**
*(Beat drops, edgy rhythm)*
Yo, check it—sunrise to the late night
Every single moment feels just RIGHT
No tomorrow, only now we know
Beach vibes, good times, watch us GLOW
Polaroid memories, living FAST
Making every second count, make it LAST
We're the kings and queens of this season
Love without a reason, that's the REASON!

**[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(PHOENIX leads)* Time stops when you're HERE with me
*(NEON harmonizes)* Frozen in this SWEET eternity
*(Together)* We got forever in a SINGLE day!

**[Chorus - ALL]**
Let's make this SUMMER LAST FOREVER!
Dancing through the STORMY weather!
Hearts on FIRE, we're burning BRIGHT!
Living like we'll NEVER see the NIGHT!
SUMMER FOREVEEEER! *(yeah-yeah-yeah)*
These GOLDEN days, we'll stay TOGETHER!
SUMMER FOREVEEEER! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*

**[Bridge - NEON emotional]**
*(Music softens, vulnerable moment)*
When September comes *(comes)*
And the summer's done *(done)*
We'll keep this feeling ALIVE
In our hearts, we'll SURVIVE
Every sunset memory *(memory)*
You and me eternally *(eternally)*

**[Final Chorus - ALL maximum energy]**
Let's make this SUMMER LAST FOREVER! *(FOREVER!)*
Dancing through the STORMY weather! *(WEATHER!)*
Hearts on FIRE, we're burning BRIGHT! *(SO BRIGHT!)*
Living like we'll NEVER see the NIGHT!
SUMMER FOREVEEEER! *(yeah-yeah-yeah)*
These GOLDEN days, we'll stay TOGETHER! *(TOGETHER!)*
SUMMER FOREVEEEER! *(ooh-ooh-ooh)*
We'll make it last FOREVEEEER!

**[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]**
*(Fading synths, ocean waves)*
Summer forever... *(forever)*
Forever... *(forever)*
Yeah-yeah-yeah...

## Generation Tips

1. **Vocal Recording**:
   - PHOENIX: Strong, belted vocals on choruses; intimate on verses
   - NEON: Smooth harmonies in thirds/fifths; emotional lead on bridge
   - REBEL: Confident, rhythmic delivery with edge

2. **Production Focus**:
   - Lead with bright, shimmering synths
   - Add beach/summer sound effects (waves, seagulls) subtly
   - Big reverb on vocals for anthemic feel
   - Drop beat on rap section for contrast

3. **Mix Priorities**:
   - PHOENIX vocals front and center (clear and bright)
   - NEON harmonies support without competing
   - REBEL rap section needs punch and clarity
   - Chorus should be massive and radio-ready

4. **Key Moments**:
   - Extended "FOREVEEEER" with vocal runs
   - Bridge drop should be intimate (just NEON + piano/light synth)
   - Final chorus needs maximum energy—all voices plus ad-libs
