Create an explosive synth-pop anthem with pulsing synthesizers, driving four-on-the-floor beats, and shimmering production. Think Dua Lipa meets CHVRCHES - vibrant, high-energy, and cosmic. Use layered vocal harmonies, bright synth arpeggios, and a massive euphoric drop in the chorus. The production should feel like stardust and electricity combined, with crisp electronic percussion and soaring melodic hooks.

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
I've been burning in the dark for way too long
Every scar became a constellation
Gravity can't hold me, I'm breaking through
Watch me turn this pain into illumination

**[Pre-Chorus]** *(NEON - 25%)*
Feel the heat rising, temperature climbing
Count to three, then I'm igniting
No more hiding in the shadows
It's my time to glow

**[Chorus]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
I'm a supernova, lighting up the sky
Watch me burn brighter than a thousand fireflies
Can't contain this energy, I'm breaking all the rules
I'm a supernova, and I'm coming through
(Supernova, supernova)
Yeah, I'm shining just for you
(Supernova, supernova)
Watch what I can do

**[Verse 2]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
Used to dim my light so you could feel okay
But I was born to be a cosmic revelation
No apologies for taking up this space
I'm a star, and baby, stars don't need permission

**[Pre-Chorus]** *(NEON - 25%)*
Feel the heat rising, temperature climbing
Count to three, then I'm igniting
No more hiding in the shadows
It's my time to glow

**[Chorus]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
I'm a supernova, lighting up the sky
Watch me burn brighter than a thousand fireflies
Can't contain this energy, I'm breaking all the rules
I'm a supernova, and I'm coming through
(Supernova, supernova)
Yeah, I'm shining just for you
(Supernova, supernova)
Watch what I can do

**[Bridge]** *(REBEL - 15%)*
They said I'd burn out, fade to black
But I'm a nuclear reaction, ain't no turning back
Explosive, corrosive to your expectations
I'm rewriting all the constellations

**[Final Chorus]** *(PHOENIX - 60% + NEON - 25%)*
I'm a supernova, lighting up the sky
Watch me burn brighter than a thousand fireflies
Can't contain this energy, I'm breaking all the rules
I'm a supernova, and I'm coming through
(Supernova, supernova)
Yeah, I'm shining just for you
(Supernova, supernova)
This is what I do

**[Outro]** *(PHOENIX - 60%)*
Supernova, supernova
I'm exploding into color
Supernova, supernova
Brighter than the others
