## Lyrics

### [Intro - Epic Guitar Harmony]
*Twin lead guitars in harmony, building drums, sustained power chord crescendo*

### [Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
Burned to the ground, nothing but dust
Everything I was turned to rust
But in the embers, I feel the heat
Death is just another heartbeat

### [Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX]
From the ruins, I hear the call
Rising up, I'll never fall

### [Chorus - PHOENIX Lead with WOLF Power Backing]
**PHOENIX:** From ashes rising, wings of flame
**WOLF:** (Wings of flame!)
**PHOENIX:** I'll never be the same
**WOLF:** (Never the same!)
**BOTH:** Burning brighter than before
From ashes rising, hear me roar
RISING FROM THE ASHES!

### [Verse 2 - WOLF]
They thought the fire would kill me dead
But I was born from burning red
Every scar is a badge I wear
Phoenix heart with a lion's stare

### [Pre-Chorus - WOLF]
From the darkness, I see the light
Rising up to take my flight

### [Chorus - BOTH Epic Power]
**BOTH:** From ashes rising, wings of flame
I'll never be the same
Burning brighter than before
From ashes rising, hear me roar
RISING FROM THE ASHES!

### [Guitar Solo]
*40 bars - Dual lead guitar harmony section, then trading solos, building to maximum intensity*

### [Bridge - Building Duet]
**PHOENIX:** Every ending is a start
**WOLF:** Rebuilt from a broken heart
**PHOENIX:** What was lost has made me strong
**WOLF:** This is where I belong
**BOTH:** Feel the fire in my veins
**BOTH:** Breaking through these chains
**BOTH:** Watch me rise! WATCH ME RISE!

### [Final Chorus - Maximum Epic Power]
**BOTH:** From ashes rising, wings of flame
I'll never be the same
Burning brighter than before
From ashes rising, hear me roar

**PHOENIX:** (Rising higher!)
**WOLF:** (Burning brighter!)
**BOTH:** From ashes rising, wings of flame
Born again to stake my claim
Burning brighter than the sun
From ashes rising, I've just begun!

### [Epic Outro]
*Twin lead guitars soaring, orchestral elements building*
**PHOENIX:** (Ad-lib) Rising... rising... rising!
**WOLF:** (Ad-lib) From the ashes!
*Guitar harmonies conclude with triumphant power chord*
