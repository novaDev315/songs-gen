## Lyrics

```
[Quiet distorted guitar with feedback]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(vulnerable)
Knocked down... but not defeated...
(no...)
This isn't how my story's ending...

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX soft]
(emotional)
Face down in the dirt, thought I'd reached my end (end...)
Broken and defeated, couldn't even pretend (fake...)
Every dream I had was shattered on the ground (ground...)
But somewhere deep inside, I heard a different sound... (sound...)

A whisper in the darkness saying "get back up" (up...)
A voice that told me I was strong enough (enough...)
To dust myself off and try this one more time (time...)
To rise again and take back what is mine! (mine!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX building]
(energy rising)
I've been down before, but I'm not staying there!
Time to rise again, time to show I care!

[Chorus - PHOENIX explosive]
(powerful grunge sound)
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (rise up!)
FROM THE ASHES OF MY PA-A-AIN! (my pain!)
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (so strong!)
NOTHING LOST, EVERYTHING TO GA-A-AIN! (to gain!)
THEY WROTE ME OFF! (wrote me off!)
BUT I'M NOT DO-O-ONE! (not done!)
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (rise!)
MY COMEBACK'S JUST BEGUN!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(building intensity)
Second chances don't come easy, had to fight for mine (fight!)
Crawled through broken glass to reach the finish line (crawl!)
Every scar I carry tells the story of my fall (fall!)
But rising from the bottom makes me ten feet tall! (tall!)

Redemption isn't given, it's earned through sweat and tears (earned!)
Fighting through the darkness, conquering my fears (fight!)
Today's the day I take my power back for good (back!)
Rising like I always knew I could! (rise!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX]
I've been down before, but I'm not staying there!
Time to rise again, time to show I care!

[Chorus - PHOENIX]
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (rise up!)
FROM THE ASHES OF MY PA-A-AIN! (my pain!)
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (so strong!)
NOTHING LOST, EVERYTHING TO GA-A-AIN! (to gain!)
THEY WROTE ME OFF! (wrote me off!)
BUT I'M NOT DO-O-ONE! (not done!)
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (rise!)
MY COMEBACK'S JUST BEGUN!

[Bridge - PHOENIX emotional peak]
(guitar solo underneath)
(vulnerable to powerful)
I was broken... (soft)
Now I'm whole... (building)
I was lost... (growing)
Found my soul... (strong)
I WAS DOWN! (powerful)
NOW I'M RISING! (explosive)
THIS COMEBACK!
IS SURPRISING!

[Final Chorus - PHOENIX maximum power]
(explosive post-grunge)
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (watch me rise!)
FROM THE ASHES OF MY PA-A-AIN! (all my pain!)
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (unstoppable!)
NOTHING LOST, EVERYTHING TO GA-A-AIN! (everything!)
THEY WROTE ME OFF! (they were wrong!)
BUT I'M NOT DO-O-ONE! (just beginning!)
I'LL RISE AGA-A-AIN! (rising!)
MY COMEBACK'S JUST BEGUN!
(MY COMEBACK'S JUST BEGUN!)

[Outro - PHOENIX]
(triumphant fade)
Rising... rising... (echo)
Again and again... (echo)
I rise... (echo)
*final distorted chord*

## Generation Tips

- Perfect for comeback stories, overcoming adversity, redemption arcs
- Verses should feel vulnerable and introspective
- Choruses should explode with cathartic power
