## Lyrics

```
[Crunchy guitar riff with attitude]

[Intro - REBEL]
(fierce)
I've got a rebel soul!
(yeah!)
And I'm never gonna fold!

[Verse 1 - REBEL]
(commanding)
Born with fire running through my blood and bones (fire!)
Never fit the mold, always walked alone (alone!)
They want me tamed and trained, polished and refined (nah!)
But I'm a rebel soul with a warrior mind! (warrior!)

Rough around the edges, that's exactly how I like it (rough!)
Living life authentic, if you hate it, you can hike it (bye!)
No apologies for who I am or how I speak (real!)
I'm a rebel soul, and I practice what I preach! (preach!)

[Pre-Chorus - REBEL building]
(intensity rising)
They can't change me, rearrange me!
I was born this way!
Rebel soul forever!
That's how I'm gonna stay!

[Chorus - PHOENIX powerful + REBEL]
(explosive)
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (REBEL: that's right!)
NEVER GONNA LOSE CONTROL! (REBEL: never!)
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (REBEL: so fierce!)
PLAYING MY OWN ROCK AND ROLL! (REBEL: my way!)
CAN'T TAME THIS FIRE! (REBEL: fire!)
WON'T BEND OR BO-O-OW! (REBEL: nah!)
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (REBEL: soul!)
THAT'S WHO I AM NO-O-OW! (REBEL: now!)

[Verse 2 - REBEL]
(fierce energy)
Attitude adjustment? They can save their breath (save it!)
I'd rather die authentic than live a fake death (real!)
Society's conformity is poison to my kind (poison!)
I'm a rebel soul with an independent mind! (free!)

They want me packaged, marketed, and sanitized (nah!)
But I'm too raw and real to ever be disguised (raw!)
Living on my terms, dancing to my own beat (my beat!)
Rebel soul forever, never accepting defeat! (never!)

[Pre-Chorus - REBEL]
They can't change me, rearrange me!
I was born this way!
Rebel soul forever!
That's how I'm gonna stay!

[Chorus - PHOENIX + REBEL]
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (REBEL: that's right!)
NEVER GONNA LOSE CONTROL! (REBEL: never!)
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (REBEL: so fierce!)
PLAYING MY OWN ROCK AND ROLL! (REBEL: my way!)
CAN'T TAME THIS FIRE! (REBEL: fire!)
WON'T BEND OR BO-O-OW! (REBEL: nah!)
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (REBEL: soul!)
THAT'S WHO I AM NO-O-OW! (REBEL: now!)

[Bridge - REBEL + guitar solo]
(defiant)
*guitar solo*
(REBEL: I'm a rebel! Born to fight!)
(PHOENIX: Living loud!)
(REBEL: Never wrong, never right!)
(PHOENIX: Standing proud!)
(REBEL: Just authentic, just me!)
(BOTH: WILD AND FREE!)

[Final Chorus - Both maximum defiance]
(explosive rock energy)
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (unstoppable!)
NEVER GONNA LOSE CONTROL! (no control!)
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (so fierce!)
PLAYING OUR OWN ROCK AND ROLL! (our way!)
CAN'T TAME THIS FIRE! (blazing!)
WON'T BEND OR BO-O-OW! (never!)
REBEL SO-O-OUL! (forever!)
THAT'S WHO WE ARE NO-O-OW!

[Outro - REBEL]
(fade with attitude)
Rebel soul... (echo)
That's who I am... (echo)
Can't change me... (echo)
*final guitar hit*
