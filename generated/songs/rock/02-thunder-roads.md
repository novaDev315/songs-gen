## Lyrics

### [Intro - Guitar Riff]
*Bluesy rock riff with Hammond organ backing, building to full band*

### [Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
Black top stretching to the sky
Engine roaring, we don't ask why
Desert wind through my hair
Freedom's calling, I don't care

### [Chorus - PHOENIX Lead with WOLF Harmony]
**PHOENIX:** Thunder roads, take me away
**WOLF:** (Take me away)
**PHOENIX:** Miles to burn, got nothing to say
**WOLF:** (Nothing to say)
**BOTH:** Roll on, roll on through the night
Thunder roads, everything's alright

### [Verse 2 - WOLF]
Radio's playing our old song
Towns we've left all fade along
Gas station lights in the rain
This highway's running through my veins

### [Chorus - BOTH Strong Harmony]
**BOTH:** Thunder roads, take me away
Miles to burn, got nothing to say
Roll on, roll on through the night
Thunder roads, everything's alright

### [Guitar Solo]
*24 bars - Classic rock solo with blues bends, wah-wah pedal effects, organ backing*

### [Bridge - Duet]
**PHOENIX:** Where we're going, nobody knows
**WOLF:** Following wherever the wind blows
**PHOENIX:** No destination, no regrets
**WOLF:** This is a ride we won't forget
**BOTH:** Just the road and you and me
**BOTH:** This is what it means to be free

### [Final Chorus - Full Power with Extensions]
**BOTH:** Thunder roads, take me away
Miles to burn, got nothing to say
Roll on, roll on through the night
Thunder roads, everything's alright

**PHOENIX:** (Keep on rolling!)
**WOLF:** (All night long!)
**BOTH:** Thunder roads, our freedom song!

### [Extended Outro]
*Guitar and organ trade solos, drums maintain driving rhythm*
**PHOENIX:** (Ad-lib) Roll on... roll on...
**WOLF:** (Ad-lib) Thunder roads...
*Fade out with continued guitar and organ jam*
