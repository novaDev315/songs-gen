## Lyrics

### [Intro - Fast Guitar Attack]
*Rapid downstroke power chords, drums counting in with rim shots*
**WOLF:** (Shouted) One! Two! Three! Four!

### [Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
Got a fire in my chest, can't put it out
Screaming silence, want to shout
Feelings like a grenade about to blow
This chaos inside, it's all I know

### [Chorus - PHOENIX Lead, WOLF Shouted Backing]
**PHOENIX:** Riot heart, tearing me apart
**WOLF:** (Tear it apart!)
**PHOENIX:** Can't control this raging start
**WOLF:** (Burn it down!)
**BOTH:** Riot, riot in my head
Riot, riot till I'm dead
RIOT HEART!

### [Verse 2 - WOLF]
Society says conform and play nice
But this anger's got me in a vice
Every rule's a chain around my neck
Time to burn it all, what the hell's next?

### [Pre-Chorus - WOLF]
I'm a bomb about to explode
About to blow, about to blow!

### [Chorus - BOTH Full Aggression]
**BOTH:** Riot heart, tearing me apart
Can't control this raging start
Riot, riot in my head
Riot, riot till I'm dead
RIOT HEART!

### [Bridge - Alternating Rapid-Fire]
**PHOENIX:** Broken glass inside my soul
**WOLF:** Losing grip, losing control
**PHOENIX:** Static noise, can't find peace
**WOLF:** This chaos will never cease
**BOTH:** We're the fuse, we're the flame
**BOTH:** We're the ones you can't tame!

### [Breakdown]
*Drums and bass only, vocals shouted rhythmically*
**BOTH:** (Rhythmic)
Riot! Heart! Chaos! Start!
Riot! Heart! Tear! Apart!

*Guitars crash back in*

### [Final Chorus - Maximum Chaos]
**BOTH:** Riot heart, tearing me apart
Can't control this raging start
Riot, riot in my head
Riot, riot till I'm dead

**PHOENIX:** (I can't stop!)
**WOLF:** (Won't stop!)
**BOTH:** RIOT HEART!

### [Aggressive Outro]
*Fast power chord sequence, building to final crash*
**BOTH:** (Shouted) RIOT! RIOT! RIOT! RIOT!
*Sudden stop on final drum hit*
