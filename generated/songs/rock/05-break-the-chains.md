## Lyrics

```
[Heavy guitar riff with hip-hop drums]

[Intro - REBEL]
(aggressive)
Yeah! Break the chains!
(let's go!)
Time to burn it down!

[Verse 1 - REBEL rap]
(rapid fire)
They tried to hold me down with invisible restraints (nah!)
Told me who to be, told me how to paint (fake!)
But I was born to break the mold, not follow rules (break!)
Time to shatter every chain, time to break the tools! (smash!)

System trying to contain me in a tiny box (box!)
But I'm a rebel with a cause, picking all the locks (click!)
Breaking free from every limit they imposed on me (free!)
Now I'm running wild and living authentically! (real!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX building]
(rock energy rising)
I can FEEL the pressure building inside!
Time to BREAK FREE, nowhere left to hide!

[Chorus - PHOENIX rock power]
(explosive rock chorus)
BREAK THE CHAINS! (REBEL: break 'em!)
THAT WERE HOLDING ME DOWN! (REBEL: down!)
BREAK THE CHAINS! (REBEL: shatter!)
NEVER GONNA DROWN! (REBEL: never!)
I'M BREAKING FRE-E-EE! (REBEL: free!)
FROM EVERYTHING THEY SAID I'D BE! (REBEL: nah!)
BREAK THE CHAINS!
THIS IS MY DESTINY!

[Verse 2 - REBEL]
(aggressive flow)
Conformity's a prison, I'm escaping from the cell (escape!)
They want me docile and compliant, I rebel (rebel!)
Every expectation becomes ammunition for my fight (fight!)
Breaking chains in broad daylight, not hiding in the night! (bright!)

Society's restrictions were designed to keep me tame (tame!)
But I was born a wildfire, I refuse to play their game (nah!)
Smashing through the barriers like a wrecking ball (smash!)
Breaking every chain, watch the whole system fall! (fall!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX]
I can FEEL the pressure building inside!
Time to BREAK FREE, nowhere left to hide!

[Chorus - PHOENIX + REBEL]
BREAK THE CHAINS! (REBEL: break 'em!)
THAT WERE HOLDING ME DOWN! (REBEL: down!)
BREAK THE CHAINS! (REBEL: shatter!)
NEVER GONNA DROWN! (REBEL: never!)
I'M BREAKING FRE-E-EE! (REBEL: free!)
FROM EVERYTHING THEY SAID I'D BE! (REBEL: nah!)
BREAK THE CHAINS!
THIS IS MY DESTINY!

[Breakdown - Heavy guitar with REBEL]
(half-time heavy)
*crushing guitar riff*
(REBEL: Break! Break! Break!)
*guitar chug*
(REBEL: Chains! Chains! Chains!)
*building back to tempo*
(REBEL: Time to burn it all down!)
(PHOENIX: BURN IT DOWN!)

[Bridge - PHOENIX + REBEL trade]
(intense)
(PHOENIX: THEY CAN'T HOLD US!)
(REBEL: Never!)
(PHOENIX: WE'RE TOO BOLD!)
(REBEL: Forever!)
(PHOENIX: BREAKING FREE!)
(REBEL: That's right!)
(BOTH: NO MORE CHAINS TONIGHT!)

[Final Chorus - Both maximum intensity]
(explosive)
BREAK THE CHAINS! (everyone!)
THAT WERE HOLDING US DOWN! (holding us!)
BREAK THE CHAINS! (shatter them!)
NEVER GONNA DROWN! (never!)
WE'RE BREAKING FRE-E-EE! (so free!)
FROM EVERYTHING THEY SAID WE'D BE! (everything!)
BREAK THE CHAINS! (break them!)
THIS IS OUR DESTINY! (our time!)

[Outro - REBEL + PHOENIX]
(fade with guitar)
(REBEL: Chains broken...)
(PHOENIX: ...we're free...)
(REBEL: Never going back...)
*final guitar hit*

- Should feel aggressive but not death metal - accessible heaviness
- REBEL rap verses contrast beautifully with PHOENIX rock choruses
- Breakdown section provides classic nu-metal moment
- Guitar riffs should be heavy but rhythmic, not chaotic
- Think Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine energy
- If not heavy enough, emphasize "heavy guitar riffs" and "aggressive"
