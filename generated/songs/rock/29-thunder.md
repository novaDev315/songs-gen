## Lyrics

[Thunder sound effect with guitar rumble]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(commanding)
*thunder crash*
Feel the thunder roll!
(yeah!)
Unstoppable force!

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
(powerful)
Rolling in like storm clouds, dark across the sky (roll!)
Lightning in my veins, you can see it in my eyes (flash!)
Thunder in my voice when I'm calling out your name (boom!)
Nothing's gonna stop me, I'm a hurricane! (storm!)

Pressure building rapidly, the atmosphere is charged (charged!)
When this thunder hits, the impact will be large (large!)
Rumbling through the valley, shaking all the ground (shake!)
I'm a force of nature, hear my thunderous sound! (boom!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(building storm)
(PHOENIX: Can you hear it coming?)
(REBEL: Thunder!)
(PHOENIX: Can you feel it drumming?)
(REBEL: Thunder!)
(BOTH: Here comes the storm!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX explosive + REBEL]
(thunderous rock)
THUN-DER! (REBEL: boom!)
ROLLING THROUGH THE SKY! (REBEL: sky!)
THUN-DER! (REBEL: crash!)
WATCH THE LIGHTNING FLY! (REBEL: fly!)
I'M A FORCE OF NA-A-ATURE! (REBEL: nature!)
CAN'T BE TAMED OR STOPPED! (REBEL: nah!)
THUN-DER! (REBEL: boom!)
RISING TO THE TOP!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(intense)
When I move, the earth shakes, aftershocks for days (shake!)
Thunder clap is deafening, lighting up the haze (boom!)
Storm surge energy, I'm flooding every space (flood!)
Hurricane intensity written on my face! (fierce!)

Tornado spinning, lifting everything in sight (spin!)
Thunder rolling constantly throughout the night (roll!)
I'm a meteorological phenomenon, it's true (true!)
When this thunder hits, you'll know exactly what to do! (run!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(PHOENIX: Can you hear it coming?)
(REBEL: Thunder!)
(PHOENIX: Can you feel it drumming?)
(REBEL: Thunder!)
(BOTH: Here comes the storm!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + REBEL]
THUN-DER! (REBEL: boom!)
ROLLING THROUGH THE SKY! (REBEL: sky!)
THUN-DER! (REBEL: crash!)
WATCH THE LIGHTNING FLY! (REBEL: fly!)
I'M A FORCE OF NA-A-ATURE! (REBEL: nature!)
CAN'T BE TAMED OR STOPPED! (REBEL: nah!)
THUN-DER! (REBEL: boom!)
RISING TO THE TOP!

[Bridge - PHOENIX + guitar solo]
(storm peak)
*lightning guitar solo*
(PHOENIX: LIGHTNING STRIKES!)
(REBEL: Flash!)
(PHOENIX: THUNDER ROLLS!)
(REBEL: Crash!)
(PHOENIX: FEEL THE POWER!)
(REBEL: Now!)
(BOTH: UNSTOPPABLE FORCE!)
*thunder crash*

[Final Chorus - Both maximum storm]
(explosive power)
THUN-DER! (everyone!)
ROLLING THROUGH THE SKY! (rolling!)
THUN-DER! (crashing!)
WATCH THE LIGHTNING FLY! (lightning!)
I'M A FORCE OF NA-A-ATURE! (unstoppable!)
CAN'T BE TAMED OR STOPPED! (never!)
THUN-DER! (thunder!)
RISING TO THE TOP! (to the top!)
THUN-DER!
(THUNDER!)

[Outro - PHOENIX]
(fade with thunder effects)
Thunder rolling... (echo)
Storm never ends... (echo)
*final thunder crash*
