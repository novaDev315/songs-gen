## Lyrics

### [Intro - Heavy Atmospheric]
*Slow, sludgy guitar with feedback, sparse drums building tension*

### [Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
Standing on the edge, looking down below
Mind's a storm, thoughts moving slow
Gravity's calling, whispers in my ear
But something keeps me here through the fear

### [Chorus - PHOENIX Lead, WOLF Anguished Backing]
**PHOENIX:** On the edge of reason, losing my mind
**WOLF:** (Losing my mind...)
**PHOENIX:** Can't leave the madness behind
**WOLF:** (Leave it behind...)
**BOTH:** Teetering between the dark and light
On the edge of reason, holding on tight

### [Verse 2 - WOLF]
Walls are closing in, can't find the door
Everything's a haze, can't take anymore
Sanity's a thread that's wearing thin
Fighting battles I can't win

### [Pre-Chorus - WOLF]
Slipping, falling, can't find ground
Lost in this internal sound

### [Chorus - BOTH Heavy and Explosive]
**BOTH:** On the edge of reason, losing my mind
Can't leave the madness behind
Teetering between the dark and light
On the edge of reason, holding on tight

### [Breakdown]
*Guitars drop to clean tone, minimal drums*
**PHOENIX:** (Spoken/whispered) How far can I fall before I break?
**WOLF:** (Spoken/whispered) How much more can I take?
*Distortion crashes back in*

### [Bridge - Intense Duet]
**PHOENIX:** My head is thunder, my thoughts are rain
**WOLF:** Living every day with this pain
**PHOENIX:** Trying to balance on this wire
**WOLF:** Caught between ice and fire
**BOTH:** On the edge, on the edge
**BOTH:** Right on the EDGE!

### [Final Chorus - Maximum Emotional Intensity]
**BOTH:** On the edge of reason, losing my mind
Can't leave the madness behind
Teetering between the dark and light
On the edge of reason, holding on tight

**PHOENIX:** (I'm barely holding on...)
**WOLF:** (Can't let go, can't let go...)
**BOTH:** On the edge of reason tonight

### [Atmospheric Outro]
*Guitars fade to clean arpeggios, ambient feedback*
**PHOENIX:** (Distant) On the edge...
**WOLF:** (Distant) Of reason...
*Feedback swells and cuts to silence*
