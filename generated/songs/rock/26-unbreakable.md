## Lyrics

```
[Building guitar with driving drums]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(defiant)
They tried to break me down...
But I'm still standing!

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
Hit me with your worst, I'll take the blow (take it!)
Knock me to the ground, watch me grow (watch!)
Every scar you leave becomes my strength (strength!)
I'll go the distance, I'll go the length! (go!)

Tried to shatter me into a million pieces (tried!)
But like a phoenix, my power never ceases (never!)
Built from broken bones and diamond skin (built!)
You can't break what's unbreakable within! (nah!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX building]
(energy rising)
I've been tested, tried, and torn apart...
But you can't break an unbreakable heart!

[Chorus - PHOENIX explosive]
(stadium anthem)
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE! (so strong!)
NOTHING YOU CAN DO OR SA-A-AY! (nothing!)
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE! (can't break!)
I GET STRONGER EVERY DA-A-AY! (stronger!)
YOU CAN TRY TO TEAR ME DO-O-OWN!
BUT I'LL NEVER HIT THE GROUND!
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE!
AND I'LL NEVER WALK AWAY!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(powerful)
Pressure turns to diamonds when you're under attack (diamonds!)
Every time you push, I'm pushing harder back (back!)
Resilience runs deeper than my DNA (deep!)
I'm unbreakable, that's all I'll ever say! (say!)

Storms can rage and thunder, lightning strike me down (strike!)
But I'll rise from the ashes wearing victory's crown (crown!)
Forged in fire, tempered by the pain (forged!)
Unbreakable, that's running through my veins! (veins!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX]
I've been tested, tried, and torn apart...
But you can't break an unbreakable heart!

[Chorus - PHOENIX]
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE! (so strong!)
NOTHING YOU CAN DO OR SA-A-AY! (nothing!)
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE! (can't break!)
I GET STRONGER EVERY DA-A-AY! (stronger!)
YOU CAN TRY TO TEAR ME DO-O-OWN!
BUT I'LL NEVER HIT THE GROUND!
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE!
AND I'LL NEVER WALK AWAY!

[Bridge - PHOENIX emotional peak]
(guitar solo underneath)
(building from soft to powerful)
You can bend me... but I won't break...
You can test me... I'm not fake...
YOU CAN HIT ME! (hit me!)
I'LL STAND TALL! (stand!)
YOU CAN'T BREAK ME!
NOT AT ALL!

[Final Chorus - PHOENIX maximum power]
(explosive stadium energy)
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE! (unbreakable!)
NOTHING YOU CAN DO OR SA-A-AY! (can't touch me!)
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE! (so strong!)
I GET STRONGER EVERY DA-A-AY! (every day!)
YOU CAN TRY TO TEAR ME DO-O-OWN! (try it!)
BUT I'LL NEVER HIT THE GROUND! (never!)
I'M UNBREAKA-A-ABLE! (yeah!)
AND I'LL NEVER WALK AWAY!
(I'LL NEVER WALK AWAY!)

[Outro - PHOENIX]
(triumphant fade with guitar)
Unbreakable... (echo)
That's who I am... (echo)
Unbreakable... (echo)
*final guitar chord*
```

## Why This Works

- **Alternative rock foundation**: Accessible yet powerful rock sound
- **PHOENIX solo showcase**: Demonstrates full emotional and vocal range
- **135 BPM**: Energetic tempo for anthemic sing-alongs
- **Major key**: Triumphant, empowering, resilient tone
- **Stadium rock energy**: Built for arena moments and fist-pumping
- **No additional personas**: Keeps focus on PHOENIX's journey
- **Emotional intensity**: Vulnerability to power arc in vocals
- **Driving guitar + pounding drums**: Classic rock anthem formula
- **Negative descriptors**: "no rap, no electronic" keeps pure rock sound

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - vocal intensity will vary
- Perfect for overcoming adversity playlists, sports motivation
- PHOENIX should showcase both vulnerability and explosive power
- Bridge guitar solo creates space for instrumental showcase
- Major key keeps it empowering, not dark or angry
- Should feel anthemic and stadium-ready
- Verses can be more intimate, choruses should explode
- If too soft, emphasize "stadium rock energy" and "powerful"
