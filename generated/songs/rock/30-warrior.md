## Lyrics

[Epic guitar intro with war drums]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(heroic)
I am a warrior!
(yeah!)
Born to fight, born to win!

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
(commanding)
Armor on my chest, sword raised to the sky (raised!)
Battle scars tell stories of the times I didn't die (survive!)
Fighting on the frontlines where the brave and bold belong (fight!)
I'm a warrior in the making of my victory song! (song!)

Every battle makes me stronger than the last one did (strong!)
Every wound I heal becomes another battle grid (grid!)
I don't run from challenges, I run towards the fight (fight!)
Warrior mentality from morning until night! (war!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX building]
(rising heroism)
I was born to fight, born to stand my ground!
I'm a warrior, hear my battle sound!

[Chorus - PHOENIX explosive arena rock]
(stadium anthem)
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (so brave!)
FIGHTING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE! (believe!)
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (so strong!)
NEVER GONNA JUST LEAVE! (never!)
WITH A HEART OF LI-O-ON! (lion!)
AND A SPIRIT THAT WON'T BREAK! (won't break!)
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (warrior!)
WHATEVER IT TAKES!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(powerful)
Courage isn't absence of fear, it's fighting through (through!)
Warrior code means doing what you're born to do (do!)
When the odds are stacked against me, I don't back away (nah!)
I'm a warrior prepared to save the day! (save!)

Shield in one hand, determination in the other (both!)
Fighting not just for me, fighting for my brothers (all!)
Battlefield is where I prove exactly who I am (am!)
I'm a warrior executing my battle plan! (plan!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX]
I was born to fight, born to stand my ground!
I'm a warrior, hear my battle sound!

[Chorus - PHOENIX]
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (so brave!)
FIGHTING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE! (believe!)
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (so strong!)
NEVER GONNA JUST LEAVE! (never!)
WITH A HEART OF LI-O-ON! (lion!)
AND A SPIRIT THAT WON'T BREAK! (won't break!)
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (warrior!)
WHATEVER IT TAKES!

[Bridge - PHOENIX + epic guitar solo]
(heroic peak)
*epic guitar solo*
(building)
When the battle calls my name... (name!)
I will answer all the same... (same!)
WITH MY HEAD HELD HIGH! (high!)
I WILL NEVER DIE! (never!)
I'M A WARRIOR!
THIS IS MY BATTLE CRY!

[Final Chorus - PHOENIX maximum heroism]
(explosive stadium energy)
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (unstoppable!)
FIGHTING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE! (everything!)
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (unbreakable!)
NEVER GONNA JUST LEAVE! (staying strong!)
WITH A HEART OF LI-O-ON! (fearless!)
AND A SPIRIT THAT WON'T BREAK! (unshakeable!)
I'M A WARRI-O-OR! (warrior!)
WHATEVER IT TAKES!
(WHATEVER IT TAKES!)

[Outro - PHOENIX]
(triumphant fade)
Warrior... (echo)
Battle cry... (echo)
Forever fight... (echo)
*final heroic guitar chord*
