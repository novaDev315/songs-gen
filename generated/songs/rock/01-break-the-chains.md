## Lyrics

### [Intro - Guitar Riff]
*Heavy distorted guitar in drop-D, drums building*

### [Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
They built these walls around my mind
Told me who I should be, what I should find
But I can feel the fire in my veins
I won't be tamed, I won't be restrained

### [Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX]
I'm done playing by their rules
Done being everyone's fool

### [Chorus - PHOENIX Lead with WOLF Backing]
**PHOENIX:** Break the chains, tear them down
**WOLF:** (Tear them down!)
**PHOENIX:** I won't wear this crown
**WOLF:** (Not anymore!)
**BOTH:** No more silence, no more pain
We're gonna break, break the chains

### [Verse 2 - WOLF]
I walked the line they drew in sand
Followed orders, every demand
But something's burning deep inside
Time to run, nowhere to hide

### [Pre-Chorus - WOLF]
No more living in their cage
Time to turn this rage

### [Chorus - BOTH Full Power]
**BOTH:** Break the chains, tear them down
I won't wear this crown
No more silence, no more pain
We're gonna break, break the chains

### [Guitar Solo]
*32 bars - Soaring lead guitar with heavy rhythm backing, building intensity*

### [Bridge - Call and Response]
**PHOENIX:** Can you hear the sound?
**WOLF:** The walls are crumbling down
**PHOENIX:** Feel the ground shake
**WOLF:** This is our escape
**BOTH:** Nothing left to lose
**BOTH:** We make our own rules!

### [Final Chorus - Maximum Power]
**BOTH:** Break the chains, tear them down
I won't wear this crown
No more silence, no more pain
We're gonna break, break, BREAK THE CHAINS

**PHOENIX:** (I'm breaking free!)
**WOLF:** (We're breaking free!)
**BOTH:** BREAK THE CHAINS!

### [Outro]
*Guitar feedback and sustained power chord, drums fade with final crash*
