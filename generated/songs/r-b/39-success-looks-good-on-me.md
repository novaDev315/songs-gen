## Lyrics

```
[Funky bass with bright keys]

[Intro - NEON]
(playful confidence)
Yeah... success looks good on me...
(uh-huh...)
Can't you see? Can't you see?

[Verse 1 - NEON smooth]
(swagger delivery)
Walking in the room and everybody notice me... (notice!)
Success is my outfit and I wear it casually... (wear it!)
Glow up so official, yeah, I'm shining bright... (shine!)
Everything I touch turns to gold, it's my right! (gold!)

Used to dream about this life, now I'm living it... (living!)
Every goal I set, yeah, I'm getting it... (getting!)
Confidence is currency and I'm a billionaire... (rich!)
Success looks good on me, you can stop and stare! (stare!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(feel-good build)
(NEON: Can you see the glow?)
(PHOENIX: Yeah, we see it!)
(NEON: Watch my success show!)
(PHOENIX: We believe it!)

[Chorus - NEON playful + PHOENIX strong]
(upbeat R&B)
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME-E-E! (PHOENIX: so good!)
CAN'T YOU SEE? CAN'T YOU SEE-E-E? (PHOENIX: we see!)
I'M LIVING MY BEST LIFE FI-NA-LLY! (PHOENIX: finally!)
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME! (PHOENIX: looks good!)
Wearing confidence! (PHOENIX: confidence!)
No coincidence! (PHOENIX: nah!)
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME-E-E! (PHOENIX: good!)
THAT'S WHO I'M MEANT TO BE!

[Verse 2 - NEON]
(smooth swagger)
Mirror mirror on the wall, I'm the fairest of them all... (all!)
Not because of looks but because I stand so tall... (tall!)
Success is my accessory, I wear it well... (wear it!)
Living testimony, I got stories to tell! (tell!)

Earned every stripe, every badge, every crown... (earned!)
From the bottom to the top of the town... (top!)
Success looks good on me, that's a fact... (fact!)
And I'm never ever taking it back! (never!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: Can you see the glow?)
(PHOENIX: Yeah, we see it!)
(NEON: Watch my success show!)
(PHOENIX: We believe it!)

[Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME-E-E! (PHOENIX: so good!)
CAN'T YOU SEE? CAN'T YOU SEE-E-E? (PHOENIX: we see!)
I'M LIVING MY BEST LIFE FI-NA-LLY! (PHOENIX: finally!)
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME! (PHOENIX: looks good!)
Wearing confidence! (PHOENIX: confidence!)
No coincidence! (PHOENIX: nah!)
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME-E-E! (PHOENIX: good!)
THAT'S WHO I'M MEANT TO BE!

[Bridge - NEON playful with PHOENIX]
(feel-good energy)
(NEON: They ask me what's my secret...)
(PHOENIX: ...tell 'em!)
(NEON: Hard work and belief, completed!)
(PHOENIX: ...facts!)
(NEON: Success is not just what you own...)
(PHOENIX: ...nah!)
(NEON: It's confidence and how you've grown!)
(BOTH: Grown!)

[Final Chorus - Both feel-good maximum]
(upbeat R&B celebration)
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME-E-E! (so good!)
CAN'T YOU SEE? CAN'T YOU SEE-E-E? (everyone sees!)
I'M LIVING MY BEST LIFE FI-NA-LLY! (my best life!)
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME! (so good!)
Wearing confidence! (every day!)
No coincidence! (earned it!)
SUCCESS LOOKS GOOD ON ME-E-E! (looks amazing!)
THAT'S WHO I'M MEANT TO BE!
(WHO I'M MEANT TO BE!)

[Outro - NEON + PHOENIX]

(NEON: Success looks good...)
(PHOENIX: ...so good...)
(NEON: Can't you see?)
(PHOENIX: ...we see!)
