## Lyrics

```
[Warm Rhodes piano with subtle bass]

[Intro - NEON]
(smooth)
Elevate... elevate my mind...
(yeah...)
Rising to a higher state...

[Verse 1 - NEON silky]
(soulful)
Used to let my thoughts control the narrative... (control...)
Now I'm writing my own story, comparative... (write...)
Meditation, education, elevation mode... (elevate...)
Unpacking all the trauma, letting burdens go... (let go...)

Reading books that feed my soul and stretch my brain... (read...)
Every lesson that I learn helps ease the pain... (ease...)
Therapy and honesty, I'm doing inner work... (work...)
Elevating my mind, watching shadows lurk... (shadows...)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON building]
(smooth intensity)
I'm growing... I'm learning... I'm turning...
Into someone new...
Elevating my mind... it's overdue...

[Chorus - NEON powerful but smooth]
(contemporary R&B)
ELEVATE MY MI-I-IND! (rising!)
LEAVE THE OLD ME BEHI-I-IND! (behind!)
GROWING INTO WHO I'M MEANT TO BE-E-E! (meant to be!)
ELEVATE MY MIND AND FINALLY I'M FREE! (free!)
Higher consciousness... (higher...)
I'm living in the light... (in the light...)
ELEVATE MY MI-I-IND! (mind!)
EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT!

[Verse 2 - NEON]
(flowing)
Affirmations in the morning, gratitude at night... (grateful...)
Positive vibrations, keeping my future bright... (bright...)
Cut out toxic energy that held me down before... (cut it...)
Elevating my mind, that's what living's for... (living...)

Mindfulness and consciousness, I'm present in the now... (present...)
Let go of the past, not worried about how... (let go...)
Just focused on my growth and mental clarity... (focus...)
Elevating my mind to who I'm meant to be! (be!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON]
I'm growing... I'm learning... I'm turning...
Into someone new...
Elevating my mind... it's overdue...

[Chorus - NEON]
ELEVATE MY MI-I-IND! (rising!)
LEAVE THE OLD ME BEHI-I-IND! (behind!)
GROWING INTO WHO I'M MEANT TO BE-E-E! (meant to be!)
ELEVATE MY MIND AND FINALLY I'M FREE! (free!)
Higher consciousness... (higher...)
I'm living in the light... (in the light...)
ELEVATE MY MI-I-IND! (mind!)
EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT!

[Bridge - NEON introspective]
(emotional depth)
(soft to building)
From the darkness... to the light...
From the struggle... to the height...
I'm ascending... I'm transcending...
My mind's elevation... never-ending...
(building)
Higher... higher... higher!

[Final Chorus - NEON maximum soul]
(powerful contemporary R&B)
ELEVATE MY MI-I-IND! (so high!)
LEAVE THE OLD ME BEHI-I-IND! (old me gone!)
GROWING INTO WHO I'M MEANT TO BE-E-E! (who I am!)
ELEVATE MY MIND AND FINALLY I'M FREE! (so free!)
Higher consciousness... (consciousness!)
I'm living in the light... (bright light!)
ELEVATE MY MI-I-IND! (elevate!)
EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT!
(EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT!)

[Outro - NEON]
(smooth fade)
Elevate... (echo)
My mind... (echo)
Rising higher... (echo)
*Rhodes piano fade*
