When you hold me, I feel invincible... (invincible...)
Your love's the fuel that makes me capable... (capable...)
Every word of encouragement you speak... (speak...)
Makes me stronger, not feeling weak... (strong...)

Love like this is rare and beautiful... (beautiful...)
Makes me feel like I'm unstoppable... (unstoppable...)
You believe in me when I forget... (believe...)
This love's the greatest power yet! (power!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX building + NEON]

(NEON: ...hear the angels sing!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX powerful + NEON harmonies]
(soul power)
UNSTOPPABLE LO-O-OVE! (NEON: unstoppable!)

You see the greatness in me I couldn't see... (see...)
Your love unlocked the best of me... (me...)
Every obstacle we face together, we're bold... (bold...)
This unstoppable love is worth more than gold! (gold!)

When the world tries to bring us to our knees... (knees...)
Our love rises up with such ease... (ease...)
Nothing can break this bond we share... (share...)
Unstoppable love beyond compare! (beyond!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]

UNSTOPPABLE LO-O-OVE! (NEON: love!)
SENT FROM HEAVEN ABOVE!

[Bridge - PHOENIX gospel-soul peak]
(emotional climax)
*strings swell*
(soft to powerful)
They said love like this doesn't exist...
But I found it... in your kiss...
(building)
UNSTOPPABLE! (NEON: unstoppable!)
UNDENIABLE! (NEON: undeniable!)
THIS LOVE IS OUR POWER!
(BOTH: OUR FINEST HOUR!)
