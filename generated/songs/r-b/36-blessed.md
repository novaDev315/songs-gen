```
[Rhodes piano + smooth bass]

[Intro - NEON] (smooth) I'm blessed... so blessed...

[Verse 1 - NEON silky]
Woke up this morning feeling grateful for the day (grateful...)
Blessed beyond measure in every single way (blessed...)
All the struggles made me stronger, can't complain (strong...)
Living in abundance, sunshine after rain! (shine...)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
I'M BLE-E-ESSED! (NEON: so blessed!)
Living at my BE-E-EST! (NEON: my best!)

[Verse 2 - NEON]
Counting all my blessings, not my problems anymore (count...)
Blessed with this life that I adore! (love...)

[Bridge - Both] (soulful)
Blessed... every moment... Blessed... I own it...

[Outro] *piano fade*
