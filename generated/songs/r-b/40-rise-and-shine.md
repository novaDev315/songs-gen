[Intro - PHOENIX]
(gospel energy)
Rise and shine!
(yeah!)
It's a brand new day!
(come on!)

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX gospel soul]
(inspiring)
Morning sun is breaking through the window pane... (breaking!)
Washing away yesterday's pain... (wash!)
God gave me another chance to make it right... (chance!)
Time to rise and shine, stepping into light! (light!)

Grateful for the breath inside my lungs... (grateful!)
Every morning mercy, that's where blessing comes... (comes!)
Yesterday is gone, tomorrow's not here yet... (gone!)
Rise and shine right now, that's a safe bet! (now!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
(building gospel)
(PHOENIX: Thank you for the morning!)
(NEON: Thank you!)
(PHOENIX: New day is dawning!)
(NEON: New day!)
(BOTH: Time to rise and shine!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX powerful + NEON harmonies]
(gospel R&B anthem)
RISE AND SHI-I-INE! (NEON: rise up!)
IT'S YOUR TI-I-IME! (NEON: your time!)
GOD GAVE YOU ANOTHER DAY TO BE GREAT! (NEON: be great!)
DON'T WASTE IT, CELEBRA-A-ATE! (NEON: celebrate!)
Morning mercies new! (NEON: so new!)
Blessings breaking through! (NEON: breaking through!)
RISE AND SHI-I-INE! (NEON: shine!)
THIS DAY IS YOURS AND MINE!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(gospel testimony)
Every morning's a testimony of grace... (grace!)
Another opportunity to run this race... (run!)
Shake off doubt and worry, put on joy instead... (joy!)
Rise and shine, that's what the Good Book said! (said!)

Morning motivation straight from Heaven's throne... (Heaven!)
Every day's a gift, you're never alone... (never!)
Purpose in your steps and power in your voice... (power!)
Rise and shine today, make the righteous choice! (choice!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]

(NEON: Thank you!)
(PHOENIX: New day is dawning!)
(NEON: New day!)
(BOTH: Time to rise and shine!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]

IT'S YOUR TI-I-IME! (NEON: your time!)
GOD GAVE YOU ANOTHER DAY TO BE GREAT! (NEON: be great!)
DON'T WASTE IT, CELEBRA-A-ATE! (NEON: celebrate!)
Morning mercies new! (NEON: so new!)
Blessings breaking through! (NEON: breaking through!)
RISE AND SHI-I-INE! (NEON: shine!)
THIS DAY IS YOURS AND MINE!
