## Lyrics

[Pounding kick drum with acid bass line]

[Intro - REBEL]
(rhythmic)
Feel the pulse! (echo)
Feel the pulse! (echo)
*kick drum intensifies*

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX rhythmic]
(driving)
PULSE! In my veins, it's driving me (driving!)
PULSE! Can you feel the energy? (energy!)
PULSE! Like a heartbeat, never stops (never!)
PULSE! Taking us straight to the top! (top!)

Relentless motion, constant forward drive (drive!)
This techno rhythm keeps me feeling alive (alive!)
Hypnotic pattern, locked into the groove (locked!)
In the warehouse, watch the whole crowd move! (move!)

[Build - PHOENIX + kick drum]
(building)
One! (kick)
Two! (kick)
Three! (kick)
Four! (kick)
Feel the pulse, feel the pulse!
(REBEL: Let's go!)

[Drop - PHOENIX over techno groove]
(minimal techno drop)
PULSE! PULSE! PULSE! PULSE!
(REBEL: yeah!)
*acid bass line*
DRIVING THROUGH THE NIGHT!
(REBEL: night!)
*industrial synths*
PULSE! PULSE! PULSE! PULSE!
(REBEL: yeah!)
*hypnotic loop*
NEVER LOSING SIGHT!
(REBEL: sight!)

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(relentless)
PULSE! Like a machine, I'm programmed to go (go!)
PULSE! 130 beats, that's all I know (know!)
PULSE! Industrial sound, it's in my soul (soul!)
PULSE! Techno rhythm taking control! (control!)

Warehouse cathedral, strobes cutting through smoke (smoke!)
Kick drum sermon, this ain't no joke (nah!)
Locked in the groove, there's no escape (locked!)
Techno trance, we're in the perfect state! (state!)

[Build - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(tension)
(PHOENIX: One!) (REBEL: kick!)
(PHOENIX: Two!) (REBEL: kick!)
(PHOENIX: Three!) (REBEL: kick!)
(PHOENIX: Four!) (REBEL: kick!)
(BOTH: Feel the pulse!)

[Drop - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(driving techno)
PULSE! PULSE! PULSE! PULSE!
(REBEL: yeah, yeah!)
*heavier acid bass*
DRIVING THROUGH THE NIGHT!
(REBEL: all night!)
*layered industrial sounds*
PULSE! PULSE! PULSE! PULSE!
(REBEL: feel it!)
*hypnotic synth pattern*
NEVER LOSING SIGHT!
(REBEL: never!)

[Bridge - PHOENIX minimal]
(stripped down to kick and vocals)
(rhythmic chant)
Pulse... (kick) ...like a heartbeat...
Pulse... (kick) ...can't be beat...
Pulse... (kick) ...in the dark...
Pulse... (kick) ...leave your mark...
*building with acid bass*
(faster)
Pulse! Pulse! Pulse! Pulse!
(REBEL: Here we go!)

[Final Drop - PHOENIX + REBEL maximum]

*complex techno layers*
NEVER LOSING SIGHT!
(REBEL: NEVER!)
*relentless kick drum*

[Outro - PHOENIX]
(fade with kick drum)
Pulse... (echo)
Feel the pulse... (echo)
*kick drum continues*
(fade to silence)

## Why This Works

- **Techno foundation**: Relentless, hypnotic, warehouse energy
- **130 BPM**: Perfect techno tempo for driving momentum
- **PHOENIX rhythmic delivery**: Matches techno's repetitive, hypnotic nature
- **REBEL hype accents**: Adds warehouse rave energy
- **Relentless kick drum**: Core techno element, never stops
- **Acid bass lines**: Classic techno sound design
- **Minor key**: Dark, industrial atmosphere
- **Industrial production**: Warehouse, underground club feel
- **Negative descriptors**: "no melodic house, no pop vocals" keeps techno pure

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - techno grooves vary in darkness and intensity
- Perfect for warehouse raves, underground clubs, techno purists
- Should feel relentless and hypnotic, not melodic or uplifting
- Kick drum should be constant and driving
- Acid bass lines provide movement without melody
- PHOENIX should be rhythmic and minimal, not power vocals
- Minimal breakdown in bridge emphasizes pulse/heartbeat concept
- If too melodic, emphasize "industrial atmosphere" and "warehouse rave"
