## Lyrics

```
[Atmospheric pad intro with trap hi-hats]

[Intro - NEON dreamy]
(ethereal)
We're ascending... ascending...
*build up*

[Verse 1 - REBEL rap]
Started at the bottom, now I'm climbing to the peak (climb!)
Every single day, I'm evolving, getting sleek (evolve!)
Metamorphosis, I'm transforming in real-time (transform!)
Left the old me in the past, now I'm in my prime! (prime!)

Elevation's more than physical, it's mental, yeah (mental!)
Breaking through dimensions, this is transcendental, yeah! (transcend!)
Used to crawl, now I fly above the clouds (fly!)
Rising through the ranks, I'm making mama proud! (proud!)

[Pre-Drop - NEON build]
(building tension)
Feel it in the air, we're about to break through-ough...
Nothing's gonna stop what we're about to do-o...

[Drop - PHOENIX powerful over future bass]
(explosive supersaw drop)
ASCEND! (REBEL: let's go!)
WE'RE RISING TO THE TOP AGAIN! (REBEL: again!)
ASCEND! (REBEL: higher!)
BREAKING THROUGH THE CEILING, FRIEND! (REBEL: break it!)
*supersaw melody*
(PHOENIX: We won't descend!)
(REBEL: Never bend!)
(PHOENIX: This is our time to ASCEND!)

[Verse 2 - REBEL fast flow]
Gravity defying, I'm a rocket to the stratosphere (zoom!)
Every obstacle I face, I make it disappear (gone!)
Transcending limitations, breaking every chain (break!)
Rising like a phoenix through the fire and the pain! (rise!)

Frequency elevating, I'm vibrating on a higher plane (high!)
Synergy with destiny, I'm dancing in the rain (dance!)
Metamorphic journey, caterpillar to a butterfly (fly!)
Now I'm soaring through dimensions in the endless sky! (soar!)

[Pre-Drop - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: Feel it in the air, we're about to break through-ough...)
(PHOENIX: Nothing's gonna stop what we're about to do-o!)

[Drop - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(massive future bass drop)
ASCEND! (REBEL: let's go!)
WE'RE RISING TO THE TOP AGAIN! (REBEL: again!)
ASCEND! (REBEL: higher!)
BREAKING THROUGH THE CEILING, FRIEND! (REBEL: break it!)
*supersaw melody with vocal chops*
(PHOENIX: We won't descend!)
(REBEL: Never bend!)
(PHOENIX: This is our time to ASCEND!)

[Bridge - NEON dreamy with PHOENIX]
(ethereal breakdown)
(NEON: From the earth... to the stars...)
(PHOENIX: Breaking free... from the bars...)
(NEON: We ascend... we transcend...)
(BOTH: This journey has no end...)
*build up with drums*

[Final Drop - All Three]
(explosive energy)
ASCEND! (everyone!)
WE'RE RISING TO THE TOP AGAIN! (to the top!)
ASCEND! (go higher!)
BREAKING THROUGH THE CEILING, FRIEND! (break through!)
*biggest supersaw drop*
(PHOENIX: WE WON'T DESCEND!)
(REBEL: NEVER BEND!)
(NEON: Forever we ascend...)
(ALL: ASCEND!)

[Outro - NEON]
(fade with atmospheric pads)
Ascending... forever ascending...
*final supersaw chord*
```

## Why This Works

- **Future bass + trap fusion**: Melodic drops with hard-hitting 808s
- **REBEL aggressive rap**: Provides grounded contrast to soaring drops
- **PHOENIX drop power**: Commands attention on explosive choruses
- **NEON dreamy bridges**: Creates ethereal atmosphere for emotional contrast
- **Minor to major progression**: Journey from struggle to triumph
- **150 BPM**: Fast enough for festival energy, perfect for trap-bass fusion
- **Supersaws + 808s**: Classic future bass trap production
- **Negative descriptors**: "no pop, no acoustic" maintains electronic purity

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - drop melodies will vary significantly
- Perfect for festival sets, gym workouts, gaming playlists
- REBEL verses should contrast with melodic drops
- PHOENIX vocals should cut through heavy bass on drops
- NEON bridges provide emotional breathing room
- Emphasize "supersaw" and "melodic drops" for authentic future bass
- If drops aren't melodic enough, specify "melodic future bass drops"
