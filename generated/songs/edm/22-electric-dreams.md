## Lyrics

```
[Dreamy piano intro with soft pads]

[Intro - NEON]
(ethereal)
Electric dreams... floating on the breeze...
(yeah...)
Lost in the melody... we're free...

[Verse 1 - NEON smooth]
(dreamy delivery)
Neon lights are dancing in the midnight air (dancing...)
Everything feels magic when you're standing there (magic...)
Colors bleeding into sound, it's so surreal (surreal...)
This electric dream is all I wanna feel! (feel...)

Synthesizers singing songs of pure emotion (pure...)
Waves of sound become an endless ocean (endless...)
Floating through dimensions made of light and sound (floating...)
In this electric dream, we're heaven-bound! (bound...)

[Build - NEON + soft PHOENIX]
(building)
(NEON: Can you feel the energy arise...?)
(PHOENIX: We're ascending to the skies...)
(NEON: In these electric dreams tonight...)
(BOTH: Everything feels right...)

[Drop - PHOENIX powerful over melodic progressive]
(euphoric melodic drop)
ELECTRIC DRE-E-EAMS! (NEON: dreams come alive!)
LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WE CAN THRI-I-IVE! (NEON: we thrive!)
EUPHORI-I-IA! (NEON: pure euphoria!)
FLOATING ON THE SOUND, NO ONE CAN DENY-Y-Y! (NEON: can't deny!)
*melodic progressive synths*
(PHOENIX: In our electric dreams!)
(NEON: Nothing's as it seems!)
(PHOENIX: We're alive tonight!)
(NEON: Pure delight!)

[Verse 2 - NEON]
(flowing)
Crystal visions shimmer in the strobe light glow (shimmer...)
Melody and rhythm in a perfect flow (perfect...)
Every moment captured in this sonic bliss (bliss...)
Electric dreams are sealed with a kiss! (kiss...)

[Build - NEON + PHOENIX harmonizing]
(emotional build)
(NEON: Can you feel the energy arise...?)
(PHOENIX: We're ascending to the skies...)
(NEON: In these electric dreams tonight...)
(BOTH: Everything feels right...)

[Drop - PHOENIX + NEON]
(massive melodic drop)
ELECTRIC DRE-E-EAMS! (NEON: dreams come alive!)
LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WE CAN THRI-I-IVE! (NEON: we thrive!)
EUPHORI-I-IA! (NEON: pure euphoria!)
FLOATING ON THE SOUND, NO ONE CAN DENY-Y-Y! (NEON: can't deny!)
*layered progressive melodies*
(PHOENIX: In our electric dreams!)
(NEON: Nothing's as it seems!)
(PHOENIX: We're alive tonight!)
(NEON: Feels so right!)

[Bridge - NEON dreamy breakdown]
(ethereal)
(soft vocals)
Close your eyes... let the music take control...
(PHOENIX: ...let it fill your soul...)
Electric dreams... where we lose all our fear...
(PHOENIX: ...the moment's here...)
*piano breakdown with subtle pads*
(building)
Rising... rising... towards the light!
(BOTH: Tonight!)

[Final Drop - Both maximum euphoria]
(explosive melodic drop)
ELECTRIC DRE-E-EAMS! (so alive!)
LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WE CAN THRI-I-IVE! (we're thriving!)
EUPHORI-I-IA! (euphoria!)
FLOATING ON THE SOUND, NO ONE CAN DENY-Y-Y! (undeniable!)
*biggest melodic progressive drop*
(PHOENIX: IN OUR ELECTRIC DREAMS!)
(NEON: Nothing's as it seems!)
(PHOENIX: WE'RE ALIVE TONIGHT!)
(NEON: Pure light!)

[Outro - NEON + PHOENIX]
(dreamy fade)
(NEON: Electric dreams...)
(PHOENIX: ...we're floating...)
(NEON: Forever in this moment...)
(BOTH: ...dreaming...)
*piano and pad fade*

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - melodic drops will vary beautifully
- Perfect for festival sunrise sets, emotional moments, trance lovers
- NEON should dominate with dreamy, flowing delivery
- PHOENIX adds power on drops without aggression
- Piano and pads should be prominent in the mix
- Melodic drops should be emotional, not just energetic
- Emphasize "melodic piano" and "lush pads" for atmospheric depth
- If too aggressive, specify "melodic progressive house, not big room"
