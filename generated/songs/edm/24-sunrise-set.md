## Lyrics

```
[Steel drum melody with ocean waves]

[Intro - NEON]
(relaxed)
Sunrise... colors painting the sky...
(yeah...)
New day... watch the world come alive...

[Verse 1 - NEON smooth]
(laid-back)
Golden light is breaking through the morning haze (breaking...)
Washing over everything in gentle waves (waves...)
Sand beneath my feet and rhythm in the breeze (breeze...)
This tropical sunrise bringing me to ease! (ease...)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX soft]
(building warmth)
(NEON: Feel the warmth upon your skin...)
(PHOENIX: Let the new day begin...)
(NEON: Every sunrise brings a chance...)
(PHOENIX: To restart the dance!)

[Drop - PHOENIX uplifting with tropical house]
(warm melodic drop)
SUNRISE SE-E-ET! (NEON: so beautiful!)
WASHING AWAY EVERY REGRE-E-ET! (NEON: no regret!)
NEW BEGINNING-S! (NEON: fresh start!)
FEEL THE WARMTH IN OUR HEARTS! (NEON: in our hearts!)
*steel drums and tropical percussion*
(PHOENIX: Every morning brings the light!)
(NEON: Everything's alright!)
(PHOENIX: Sunrise set, we're free!)
(NEON: By the sea!)

[Verse 2 - NEON]
(flowing)
Palm trees swaying to the rhythm of the tide (swaying...)
Ocean breeze is whispering, there's nothing left to hide (nothing...)
Every color in the sky tells a brand new story (story...)
This sunrise moment, basking in the glory! (glory...)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: Feel the warmth upon your skin...)
(PHOENIX: Let the new day begin...)
(NEON: Every sunrise brings a chance...)
(PHOENIX: To restart the dance!)

[Drop - PHOENIX + NEON]
(tropical house groove)
SUNRISE SE-E-ET! (NEON: so beautiful!)
WASHING AWAY EVERY REGRE-E-ET! (NEON: no regret!)
NEW BEGINNING-S! (NEON: fresh start!)
FEEL THE WARMTH IN OUR HEARTS! (NEON: in our hearts!)
*flute melody with steel drums*
(PHOENIX: Every morning brings the light!)
(NEON: Everything's alright!)
(PHOENIX: Sunrise set, we're free!)
(NEON: By the sea!)

[Bridge - NEON relaxed with PHOENIX]
(mellow breakdown)
(NEON: Orange and pink across the water...)
(PHOENIX: ...getting brighter, getting warmer...)
(NEON: New day rising, new perspectives...)
(PHOENIX: ...living in the moment, no objectives...)
*tropical percussion builds*
(building)
(BOTH: Sun is rising... sun is calling...)
(BOTH: New day, new day... new day's dawning!)

[Final Drop - Both warm and uplifting]
(full tropical house)
SUNRISE SE-E-ET! (so beautiful!)
WASHING AWAY EVERY REGRE-E-ET! (all gone!)
NEW BEGINNING-S! (every day!)
FEEL THE WARMTH IN OUR HEARTS! (feel it!)
*full tropical production*
(PHOENIX: EVERY MORNING BRINGS THE LIGHT!)
(NEON: Everything's so right!)
(PHOENIX: SUNRISE SET, WE'RE FREE!)
(NEON: By the sea, by the sea!)

[Outro - NEON + PHOENIX]
(fade with steel drums and waves)
(NEON: Sunrise... sunset...)
(PHOENIX: ...every day's a gift...)
(NEON: By the ocean...)
(PHOENIX: ...we drift...)
*ocean waves and steel drum fade*
