## Lyrics

```
[Ominous sub-bass rumble intro]

[Intro - REBEL]
(aggressive)
Welcome to the kingdom!
(yeah!)
Where the bass drops REIGN!
(let's go!)

[Verse 1 - REBEL commanding]
(powerful)
I'm the ruler of the low end, feel the sub-bass shake (shake!)
Every drop I bring will make the whole foundation quake (quake!)
Wobble bass is weapons, I'm armed for the attack (armed!)
In this bass drop kingdom, there ain't no turning back! (nah!)

Heavy is the crown when you're king of the sound (king!)
140 BPM, that's how we get down (down!)
Distortion and aggression in the frequency war (war!)
When the bass drops hit, you'll be begging for more! (more!)

[Pre-Drop - PHOENIX powerful build]
(building tension)
Can you feel the pressure building in the air?
(REBEL: yeah!)
When this bass drops, better say your prayer!
(REBEL: let's go!)
THREE! TWO! ONE!
DROP IT!

[Drop - REBEL over massive wobble bass]
(explosive dubstep drop)
BASS DROP KINGDOM! (growl)
*massive wobble bass*
FEEL THE BASS TAKE CONTROL!
*distorted synth stabs*
BASS DROP KINGDOM! (growl)
*heavy wobble*
SHAKING DOWN YOUR SOUL!
*sub-bass rumble*
(REBEL: This is the kingdom!)
*wobble bass pattern*
(REBEL: Bow down!)
*heavy drop*

[Verse 2 - REBEL]
(aggressive energy)
Frequency assassin, killing every track I touch (kill it!)
Headbanging mandatory, this ain't for the soft, it's rough (rough!)
Earthquake simulator when the sub-bass hits (boom!)
In this kingdom made of bass, we don't do the splits! (nah!)

Dubstep dynasty, I built it from the ground (built!)
Crown made of wobbles, heaviest around (heavy!)
When I say drop, the whole world obeys (drop!)
Bass drop kingdom ruling all the days! (rule!)

[Pre-Drop - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(massive build)
(PHOENIX: Can you feel the pressure building in the air?)
(REBEL: YEAH!)
(PHOENIX: When this bass drops, better say your prayer!)
(REBEL: HERE WE GO!)
(BOTH: THREE! TWO! ONE!)
(REBEL: DROP IT!)

[Drop - REBEL + PHOENIX]
(bigger dubstep drop)
BASS DROP KINGDOM! (growl)
*massive wobble bass*
FEEL THE BASS TAKE CONTROL!
*distorted synth stabs*
BASS DROP KINGDOM! (growl)
*heavier wobble*
SHAKING DOWN YOUR SOUL!
*sub-bass rumble*
(PHOENIX: THIS IS THE KINGDOM!)
*complex wobble pattern*
(REBEL: WE REIGN!)
*explosive drop*

[Bridge - REBEL breakdown]
(half-time feel)
(commanding)
In the kingdom... (echo)
Where the bass drops rule... (echo)
If you can't handle the pressure... (echo)
Then you're just a fool! (echo)
*building back to full tempo*
(REBEL: Let's bring it back!)
(PHOENIX: ONE MORE TIME!)

[Final Drop - Both maximum aggression]
(biggest drop)
BASS DROP KINGDOM! (everyone!)
*most massive wobble bass*
FEEL THE BASS TAKE CONTROL! (take it!)
*aggressive synth stabs*
BASS DROP KINGDOM! (kingdom!)
*heaviest wobble*
SHAKING DOWN YOUR SOUL! (your soul!)
*deepest sub-bass*
(REBEL: THIS IS OUR KINGDOM!)
*complex wobble patterns*
(PHOENIX: WE RULE THE BASS!)
(REBEL: BOW DOWN!)
*final massive drop*

[Outro - REBEL]
(fade with wobble bass)
The kingdom... (echo)
Bass drops forever... (echo)
*final wobble bass hit*
```

## Why This Works

- **Dubstep foundation**: Heavy, aggressive, bass-focused production
- **140 BPM**: Classic dubstep tempo for maximum headbang potential
- **REBEL aggressive command**: Perfect for commanding bass-heavy drops
- **PHOENIX pre-drop builds**: Adds anticipation and tension release
- **Massive wobble bass**: Core element of dubstep sound design
- **Minor key**: Adds darkness and intensity to bass drops
- **Sub-bass rumble**: Physical, visceral low-end presence
- **Negative descriptors**: "no pop, no melodic house" keeps dubstep pure

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - wobble bass patterns vary drastically
- Perfect for headbangers, dubstep fans, bass-heavy gym workouts
- Emphasize "massive wobble bass" and "sub-bass rumble" for authenticity
- REBEL should sound commanding and aggressive, not melodic
- PHOENIX builds create tension for explosive drops
- Half-time bridge section provides contrast before final drop
- If not heavy enough, specify "riddim dubstep" or "heavy dubstep"
- Should feel physical and visceral, not just loud
