## Why This Works

- **Big room house energy**: Maximum festival impact and crowd engagement
- **128 BPM**: Perfect tempo for big room house and crowd jumps
- **PHOENIX commanding drops**: Powerful vocals cut through massive production
- **REBEL hype sections**: Adds aggressive festival energy and crowd interaction
- **Massive kicks + saw synths**: Classic big room house signature sound
- **Minor key**: Adds intensity and festival anthem feel
- **Stadium energy**: Built for main stage moments
- **Negative descriptors**: "no ballad, no slow sections" maintains energy

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - drop energy will vary significantly
- Perfect for festival main stages, big room DJ sets, peak-time moments
- Should feel massive and stadium-ready
- PHOENIX drop vocals should be commanding, not melodic
- REBEL hype sections create crowd participation moments
- "Jump" sections should coincide with kick drum breakdowns
- Emphasize "massive kicks" and "explosive drops" for authentic big room
- If not aggressive enough, specify "festival main stage energy"
