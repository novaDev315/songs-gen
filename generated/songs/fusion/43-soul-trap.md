## Lyrics

```
[Slow Rhodes piano with subtle 808s]

[Intro - NEON]
(soulful)
Soul trap... feeling the pain...
(yeah...)
Rising through the rain...

[Verse 1 - NEON slow soul @ 85 BPM]
(emotional)
Sometimes I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders... (weight...)
Every day I'm getting wiser and a little bit older... (older...)
Pain in my chest but I'm fighting through the struggle... (fight...)
Soul trap music helping me through the trouble... (help...)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER introspective rap @ 85 BPM]
(honest flow)
Therapy sessions in my lyrics, this is how I cope (cope!)
Soul music mixed with trap beats, that's my rope (rope!)
Climbing out the darkness into something brighter now (bright!)
Soul trap fusion showing me exactly how! (how!)

Used to hide my feelings, thought that crying wasn't strong (nah!)
But expressing all my pain is where I truly belong (belong!)
Soul trap genre got me feeling less alone (less!)
Every beat and every note helping me atone! (tone!)

[Build @ 95 BPM - NEON + CYPHER]
(tempo increasing)
(NEON: From the pain...)
(CYPHER: ...to the triumph...)
(NEON: From the rain...)
(CYPHER: ...to the sunshine...)
(building tension)

[Chorus @ 140 BPM - NEON powerful + CYPHER]
(soul-trap anthem)
SOUL TRA-A-AP! (CYPHER: soul!)
HEALING ALL MY WOUNDS LIKE THA-A-AT! (CYPHER: healing!)
FROM THE DARKNESS TO THE LI-I-IGHT! (CYPHER: light!)
SOUL TRAP GETTING ME RIGHT! (CYPHER: right!)
*808s hit with soul vocals*
Feel the pain! (CYPHER: pain!)
Break the chain! (CYPHER: break!)
SOUL TRA-A-AP! (CYPHER: trap!)
SUNSHINE AFTER RAIN!

[Verse 3 - NEON @ 85 BPM]
(soulful vulnerability)
Tears mixed with triumph, that's the story of my life... (life...)
Soul music with the trap beats cutting like a knife... (knife...)
Opening my heart on every track I make... (open...)
Soul trap fusion, that's the risk I take... (take...)

[Verse 4 - CYPHER @ 95 BPM]
(building intensity)
From the bottom of my feelings to the top of my game (game!)
Soul trap music helped me overcome the shame (shame!)
Vulnerability is strength, that's what I learned (learned!)
Every bridge I crossed, every lesson that I earned! (earned!)

[Build - NEON + CYPHER]
(tempo rising)
(NEON: From the pain...)
(CYPHER: ...to the triumph...)
(NEON: From the rain...)
(CYPHER: ...to the sunshine...)

[Chorus @ 140 BPM - Both]
SOUL TRA-A-AP! (CYPHER: soul!)
HEALING ALL OUR WOUNDS LIKE THA-A-AT! (CYPHER: healing!)
FROM THE DARKNESS TO THE LI-I-IGHT! (CYPHER: light!)
SOUL TRAP GETTING US RIGHT! (CYPHER: right!)
*heavy 808s with soul power*
Feel the pain! (CYPHER: pain!)
Break the chain! (CYPHER: break!)
SOUL TRA-A-AP! (CYPHER: trap!)
SUNSHINE AFTER RAIN!

[Bridge @ 120 BPM - NEON soul peak]
(emotional climax)
*strings swell over 808s*
(NEON: I was broken... now I'm whole...)
(CYPHER: Soul trap saved my soul!)
(NEON: I was lost... now I'm found...)
(CYPHER: Soul trap is the sound!)
*building to final drop*

[Final Chorus @ 140 BPM - Both maximum]
(full soul-trap power)
SOUL TRA-A-AP! (so powerful!)
HEALING ALL OUR WOUNDS LIKE THA-A-AT! (complete healing!)
FROM THE DARKNESS TO THE LI-I-IGHT! (to the light!)
SOUL TRAP GETTING US RIGHT! (so right!)
*biggest 808s with soul vocals*
Feel the pain! (all the pain!)
Break the chain! (freedom!)
SOUL TRA-A-AP! (soul trap!)
SUNSHINE AFTER RAIN!
(AFTER RAIN!)

[Outro @ 85 BPM - NEON + CYPHER]
(slow return to soul)
(NEON: Soul trap... healing...)
(CYPHER: ...from the pain...)
(NEON: Rising through...)
(CYPHER: ...the rain...)
*Rhodes and 808 fade*

- **Dynamic tempo**: 85 BPM verses build to 140 BPM drops for journey
- **Minor to major progression**: Musical arc mirrors emotional journey
- **Rhodes piano with 808s**: Classic soul meets modern trap
- **Live strings with trap drums**: Organic emotion meets electronic power

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - emotional intensity varies dramatically
- Perfect for emotional playlists, therapeutic music, authentic expression
- Slow verses should feel intimate and vulnerable
- Fast choruses should feel cathartic and powerful
- NEON needs full emotional range, not just power
- CYPHER should be introspective and honest, not braggadocious
- Tempo transitions create emotional journey
- Rhodes piano + 808s balance is crucial for fusion
- Should feel therapeutic and genuine, not manufactured
- If too trap, emphasize "Rhodes piano" and "live strings"
- If too soul, emphasize "808s" and "trap drums"
