## Lyrics

```
[808 bass with bright synth melodies]

[Intro - NEON]
(auto-tune melodic)
We made it... we finally made it...
(yeah...)
Everything we dreamed...

[Verse 1 - CYPHER storytelling]
(smooth flow)
Started from the bottom with a dollar and a dream (dream!)
Now I'm living proof that nothing's as it seems (proof!)
They said it couldn't happen, that I'd never make it far (nah!)
Now I'm shining brighter than a supernova star! (shine!)

Every sacrifice was worth it for this moment here (worth!)
Vision 20/20, now my future's crystal clear (clear!)
From the struggle to the glow-up, watch the transformation (glow!)
Made it to the top, this is my celebration! (made it!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON melodic]
(auto-tune smooth)
We were dreaming, now we're living... (living...)
All the doubt, we're not giving... (not giving...)
Made it to the promised land... (land...)
Everything went as planned!

[Chorus - NEON + CYPHER]
(pop-trap anthem)
WE MADE I-I-IT! (CYPHER: yeah we did!)
CAN'T BELIEVE WE FINALLY DI-I-ID! (CYPHER: finally!)
FROM THE STRUGGLE TO THE SUMMI-I-IT! (CYPHER: summit!)
WE MADE IT, WE MADE I-I-IT! (CYPHER: made it!)
Celebration time! (CYPHER: celebrate!)
Everything is fine! (CYPHER: so fine!)
WE MADE I-I-IT! (CYPHER: made it!)
AND WE'RE FEELING SO DIVINE!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(energetic flow)
Toast to the victories, the ones we fought to earn (toast!)
Every lesson from the losses, every bridge we had to burn (burn!)
Made it through the darkness into glorious light (light!)
Now we're celebrating life, everything is right! (right!)

Remember when we had nothing but ambition and a plan? (remember!)
Now we're living in the moment, doing everything we can (can!)
Made it past the critics and the doubters who said no (nah!)
Now we're at the victory party, putting on a show! (show!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON]
We were dreaming, now we're living... (living...)
All the doubt, we're not giving... (not giving...)
Made it to the promised land... (land...)
Everything went as planned!

[Chorus - NEON + CYPHER]
WE MADE I-I-IT! (CYPHER: yeah we did!)
CAN'T BELIEVE WE FINALLY DI-I-ID! (CYPHER: finally!)
FROM THE STRUGGLE TO THE SUMMI-I-IT! (CYPHER: summit!)
WE MADE IT, WE MADE I-I-IT! (CYPHER: made it!)
Celebration time! (CYPHER: celebrate!)
Everything is fine! (CYPHER: so fine!)
WE MADE I-I-IT! (CYPHER: made it!)
AND WE'RE FEELING SO DIVINE!

[Bridge - PHOENIX powerful + NEON]
(emotional peak)
(PHOENIX: This is for the nights we cried!)
(NEON: We cried...)
(PHOENIX: For the times we had to hide!)
(NEON: Had to hide...)
(PHOENIX: NOW WE'RE STANDING IN THE LIGHT!)
(NEON: In the light!)
(BOTH: WE MADE IT, WE MADE IT RIGHT!)

[Final Chorus - All Three]
(maximum celebration)
WE MADE I-I-IT! (everyone!)
CAN'T BELIEVE WE FINALLY DI-I-ID! (we did it!)
FROM THE STRUGGLE TO THE SUMMI-I-IT! (to the top!)
WE MADE IT, WE MADE I-I-IT! (we made it!)
Celebration time! (celebrate!)
Everything is fine! (perfect!)
WE MADE I-I-IT! (made it!)
AND WE'RE FEELING SO DIVINE!
(SO DIVINE!)

[Outro - NEON + CYPHER]
(fade with 808s and melodies)
(NEON: We made it...)
(CYPHER: ...yeah we did...)
(NEON: Finally here...)
(CYPHER: ...no more fear...)
*synth and 808 fade*

- CYPHER verses should flow smoothly, not aggressively
- NEON hooks should be melodic and catchy
- PHOENIX bridge creates emotional climax
