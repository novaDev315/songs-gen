## Lyrics

```
[Upright bass line with trap hi-hats and saxophone]

[Intro - NEON]
(sultry)
Trap jazz... so smooth...
(yeah...)
Sophisticated groove...

[Verse 1 - CYPHER jazz rap]
(smooth flow)
Sipping cognac while I'm counting up these dividends (sip!)
Jazz in my soul but the trap is where I'm living in (living!)
Sophisticated hustle, I'm a cultured kind of boss (boss!)
Saxophones and 808s, profit without loss! (profit!)

Three-piece suit with the sneakers, that's my uniform (suit!)
Trap house meetings where the jazz quartet performs (perform!)
Elegant aggression, refined but still relentless (refined!)
This trap jazz fusion got the critics all defenseless! (jazz!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON sultry]
(smoky vocals)
Smooth like jazz, hard like trap...
Money in the bag, that's a fact...

[Chorus - NEON + CYPHER]
(jazz-trap fusion)
TRAP JA-A-AZZ! (CYPHER: so smooth!)
SOPHISTICATED WHEN WE MA-A-AKE OUR MOVES! (CYPHER: moves!)
CLASSY HUSTLE WITH THE 808 GRO-O-OVE! (CYPHER: groove!)
TRAP JAZZ, NOTHING LEFT TO PRO-O-OVE! (CYPHER: proved!)
*saxophone solo over 808s*
Refined and raw! (CYPHER: both!)
That's what we saw! (CYPHER: saw!)
TRAP JA-A-AZZ! (CYPHER: jazz!)
BREAKING EVERY LAW!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(sophisticated flow)
Boardroom to the studio, I'm fluid with transitions (fluid!)
Jazz improvisation meets my trap ambitions (trap!)
Reading Malcolm Gladwell while the 808s are knocking (knock!)
Trap jazz portfolio, my assets keep on rocking! (rock!)

Champagne toasts to the hustle, caviar on crackers (toast!)
While the saxophone whispers over trap high-hat attackers (whisper!)
Intellectual property meets street credibility (meets!)
Trap jazz fusion is my brand's utility! (brand!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON]
Smooth like jazz, hard like trap...
Money in the bag, that's a fact...

[Chorus - NEON + CYPHER]
TRAP JA-A-AZZ! (CYPHER: so smooth!)
SOPHISTICATED WHEN WE MA-A-AKE OUR MOVES! (CYPHER: moves!)
CLASSY HUSTLE WITH THE 808 GRO-O-OVE! (CYPHER: groove!)
TRAP JAZZ, NOTHING LEFT TO PRO-O-OVE! (CYPHER: proved!)
*saxophone solo over 808s*
Refined and raw! (CYPHER: both!)
That's what we saw! (CYPHER: saw!)
TRAP JA-A-AZZ! (CYPHER: jazz!)
BREAKING EVERY LAW!

[Bridge - NEON sultry with CYPHER]
(jazz breakdown)
*live jazz band moment*
(NEON: Smooth operator... sophisticated gangster...)
(CYPHER: Trap jazz innovator, cultured trendsetter!)
*building back to trap*
(NEON: From the jazz club...)
(CYPHER: ...to the trap house...)
(BOTH: Fusion so smooth, there's no way out!)

[Final Chorus - Both sophisticated]
(full jazz-trap fusion)
TRAP JA-A-AZZ! (so sophisticated!)
SOPHISTICATED WHEN WE MA-A-AKE OUR MOVES! (smooth moves!)
CLASSY HUSTLE WITH THE 808 GRO-O-OVE! (that groove!)
TRAP JAZZ, NOTHING LEFT TO PRO-O-OVE! (nothing!)
*biggest saxophone over 808s*
Refined and raw! (perfection!)
That's what we saw! (we saw it!)
TRAP JA-A-AZZ! (trap jazz!)
BREAKING EVERY LAW!

[Outro - NEON + CYPHER]
(fade with jazz and trap)
(NEON: Trap jazz...)
(CYPHER: ...so smooth...)
(NEON: Sophisticated groove...)
(CYPHER: ...that's how we move...)
*saxophone and 808 fade*
