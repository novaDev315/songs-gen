## Lyrics

```
[Ethnic strings with trap 808s and global percussion]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(world-influenced)
Global grind... worldwide hustle...
(yeah...)
From every corner of the earth...

[Verse 1 - CYPHER multicultural rap]
(diverse flow)
From Tokyo to Paris, Lagos to LA (global!)
International hustle, making moves every day (day!)
Breaking down borders with my worldwide grind (grind!)
Success speaks every language, that's what I find! (find!)

Sipping chai in Mumbai, closing deals in Dubai (deals!)
Seoul to São Paulo, watch my empire multiply (multi!)
Global mindset, passport full of stamps and dreams (stamps!)
Success is universal, or so it seems! (seems!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(building)
(NEON: From east to west, north to south...)
(PHOENIX: Global grind, that's what it's about!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX world vocals + CYPHER]
(world-trap fusion)
GLOBAL GRI-I-IND! (CYPHER: worldwide!)
HUSTLE IN EVERY COUNTRY, EVERY TI-I-IME! (CYPHER: every time!)
FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SE-E-EA! (CYPHER: to the sea!)
GLOBAL GRIND IS WHO WE BE! (CYPHER: who we be!)
*ethnic instruments with 808 drops*
(NEON: Worldwide hustle!)
*global percussion with trap hi-hats*
East to west! (CYPHER: west!)
Worldwide best! (CYPHER: best!)
GLOBAL GRI-I-IND! (CYPHER: grind!)
NEVER REST!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(international energy)
Trading crypto in Berlin, real estate in Shanghai (trade!)
From the medinas of Morocco to the New York sky high (high!)
No translation needed when the money talks (money!)
Global grind mentality in every city block! (block!)

Collecting culture and connections like I'm building art (art!)
Every continent I touch becomes a brand new start (start!)
International hustle, multi-lingual grind (grind!)
Success is borderless when you've got the mind! (mind!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: From east to west, north to south...)
(PHOENIX: Global grind, that's what it's about!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + CYPHER + NEON]
GLOBAL GRI-I-IND! (everyone!)
HUSTLE IN EVERY COUNTRY, EVERY TI-I-IME! (all the time!)
FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SE-E-EA! (mountains!)
GLOBAL GRIND IS WHO WE BE! (that's us!)
*bigger ethnic-trap fusion*
(NEON: Worldwide hustle!)
*heavier global percussion*
East to west! (CYPHER: west!)
Worldwide best! (CYPHER: best!)
GLOBAL GRI-I-IND! (CYPHER: grind!)
NEVER REST!

[Bridge - PHOENIX world vocals]
(multicultural celebration)
*diverse ethnic instruments*
(PHOENIX: From every language, every land...)
(NEON: ...we hustle hand in hand...)
(PHOENIX: From every culture, every creed...)
(CYPHER: ...global grind is all we need!)
*building with global percussion*
(ALL: Worldwide! Worldwide!)

[Verse 3 - CYPHER global rap]
(celebrating diversity)
Shoutout to the hustlers in Rio de Janeiro (Rio!)
Stockholm to Manila, Cairo to Bolero (global!)
From the townships to the penthouses worldwide (wide!)
Global grind connects us all with pride! (pride!)

Different languages but the hustle's universal (facts!)
From the Arctic to the tropics, we're commercial (commercial!)
International squad, that's the global grind way (way!)
Making money moves in every time zone, every day! (day!)

[Final Chorus - All Three maximum global]
(explosive world-trap fusion)
GLOBAL GRI-I-IND! (so worldwide!)
HUSTLE IN EVERY COUNTRY, EVERY TI-I-IME! (everywhere!)
FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SE-E-EA! (from everywhere!)
GLOBAL GRIND IS WHO WE BE! (that's who we are!)
*biggest ethnic instruments with 808s*
(NEON: WORLDWIDE HUSTLE!)
*maximum global percussion*
East to west! (everywhere!)
Worldwide best! (the best!)
GLOBAL GRI-I-IND! (global!)
NEVER REST! WE NEVER REST!

[Outro - All Three]
(fade with world-trap fusion)
(PHOENIX: Global grind...)
(NEON: ...worldwide hustle...)
(CYPHER: ...from every corner...)
(ALL: ...global grind forever...)
*ethnic instruments and 808s fade*
