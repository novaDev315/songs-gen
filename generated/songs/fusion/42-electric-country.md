## Lyrics

```
[Banjo riff with electronic build-up]

[Intro - REBEL]
(hyped)
Let's get electric!
(yeah!)
Country style!

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX country]
(energetic country)
Tailgate party with the speakers bumping loud (bump!)
Country roads meeting electronic crowds (crowds!)
Boots and bass drops, that's the vibe we bring (bring!)
Electric country is the new way to sing! (sing!)

Pickup trucks with the LED lights glowing bright (glow!)
Mixing southern twang with the festival night (night!)
Cowboys and ravers, everybody getting down (down!)
Electric country taking over the town! (town!)

[Build - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(building tension)
(PHOENIX: Can you feel it building?)
(REBEL: Yeah!)
(PHOENIX: Country meet electric!)
(REBEL: Let's go!)

[Drop - PHOENIX over electronic country]
(EDM-country fusion)
ELECTRIC COU-U-UNTRY! (REBEL: party!)
THIS AIN'T YOUR DADDY'S WAY TO DO-O-O IT! (REBEL: new way!)
ELECTRIC COU-U-UNTRY! (REBEL: country!)
BANJO DROPS AND WE'RE GETTING TO-O-O IT! (REBEL: get it!)
*banjo with synth drop*
(REBEL: Hands up! Drop!)
*electronic bass with country melody*
Boots on, bass up! (REBEL: up!)
Fill your cup! (REBEL: drink!)
ELECTRIC COU-U-UNTRY! (REBEL: country!)
WE DON'T STOP!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(country swagger)
Hay bales and lasers, that's the party scene (party!)
Country meets future, something in between (between!)
Steel guitar with the synthesizer sound (sound!)
Electric country shaking the ground! (shake!)

From the barn to the main stage festival lights (lights!)
Southern hospitality meets electronic nights (nights!)
This fusion got the whole crowd moving as one (one!)
Electric country, we're just having fun! (fun!)

[Build - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(PHOENIX: Can you feel it building?)
(REBEL: Yeah!)
(PHOENIX: Country meet electric!)
(REBEL: Drop it!)

[Drop - PHOENIX + REBEL]
(bigger EDM-country drop)
ELECTRIC COU-U-UNTRY! (REBEL: party!)
THIS AIN'T YOUR DADDY'S WAY TO DO-O-O IT! (REBEL: new way!)
ELECTRIC COU-U-UNTRY! (REBEL: country!)
BANJO DROPS AND WE'RE GETTING TO-O-O IT! (REBEL: get it!)
*bigger banjo-synth fusion*
(REBEL: Hands up! Drop!)
*heavier electronic bass*
Boots on, bass up! (REBEL: up!)
Fill your cup! (REBEL: drink!)
ELECTRIC COU-U-UNTRY! (REBEL: country!)
WE DON'T STOP!

[Bridge - PHOENIX country builds]

(PHOENIX: This is for the country kids who love to rave!)
(REBEL: Rave!)
(PHOENIX: And the ravers who got country in their veins!)

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - fusion balance varies greatly
- Perfect for country festivals, modern country fans, EDM country crossover
- Should feel fun and party-ready, not forced
- PHOENIX needs country twang but EDM energy
- Banjo should be prominent in drops, not buried
- Electronic drops should maintain country melody
- REBEL adds festival hype without overwhelming country vibe
- Think Blanco Brown, Diplo country-EDM fusion
- If too EDM, emphasize "banjo" and "country twang"
- If too country, emphasize "electronic drops" and "synths"
