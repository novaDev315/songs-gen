## Lyrics

```
[Dark atmospheric pads with hard 808s]

[Intro - REBEL]
(aggressive)
Elevate! Elevate!
(yeah!)
Rising to the top!

[Verse 1 - CYPHER motivational]
(clear flow)
Started from the ground floor, now I'm rising fast (rising!)
Every level that I reach, I know it's not the last (nah!)
Elevator going up, ain't no coming down (up!)
Elevated mindset, wearing success like a crown! (crown!)

Atmosphere is changing as I reach for higher ground (change!)
Gravity can't hold me, I'm ascending without sound (fly!)
Level after level, breaking through the ceiling tiles (break!)
Elevating my life, I'm going miles and miles! (miles!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON melodic]
(auto-tune)
Going up, up, up... never coming down...
Rising to the top... wearing the crown...

[Chorus - REBEL aggressive + CYPHER]
(trap anthem)
ELEVA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: rise up!)
AIN'T NO TIME TO HESITA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: nah!)
ELEVA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: go!)
LIVING LIFE AT A DIFFERENT RA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: different!)
Higher! (CYPHER: higher!)
Never tire! (CYPHER: never!)
ELEVA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: elevate!)
SETTING THE WHOLE WORLD ON FIRE!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Elevating my thinking, elevating my game (game!)
Elevating my status, elevating my name (name!)
From the basement to the penthouse, climbing every stair (climb!)
Elevated perspective, breathing rarified air! (breathe!)

They can stay down low if that's what they prefer (stay!)
But I'm elevating constantly, that's what I concur (facts!)
Altitude adjusting as I reach atmospheric heights (high!)
Elevating everything, setting my future sights! (sight!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON]
Going up, up, up... never coming down...
Rising to the top... wearing the crown...

[Chorus - REBEL + CYPHER]
ELEVA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: rise up!)
AIN'T NO TIME TO HESITA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: nah!)
ELEVA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: go!)
LIVING LIFE AT A DIFFERENT RA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: different!)
Higher! (CYPHER: higher!)
Never tire! (CYPHER: never!)
ELEVA-A-ATE! (CYPHER: elevate!)
SETTING THE WHOLE WORLD ON FIRE!

[Bridge - NEON melodic with REBEL]
(atmospheric breakdown)
(NEON: From the bottom to the sky... we fly...)
(REBEL: Elevate!)
(NEON: Never asking questions why... we try...)
(REBEL: Elevate!)
(building)
(NEON: Rising... rising... to the top!)
(REBEL: WE WON'T STOP!)

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + REBEL adlibs]
(triumphant)
This elevation ain't just physical, it's mental too (mental!)
Spiritual ascension to a higher point of view (view!)
Economic elevation, building generational wealth (wealth!)
Elevating everyone around me, that's my stealth! (REBEL: elevate!)

[Final Chorus - All Three]
(maximum trap energy)
ELEVA-A-ATE! (everyone!)
AIN'T NO TIME TO HESITA-A-ATE! (no time!)
ELEVA-A-ATE! (rising!)
LIVING LIFE AT A DIFFERENT RA-A-ATE! (different!)
Higher! (so high!)
Never tire! (never!)
ELEVA-A-ATE! (elevate!)
SETTING THE WHOLE WORLD ON FIRE!
(WORLD ON FIRE!)

[Outro - NEON + REBEL]
(fade with 808s)
(NEON: Elevate...)
(REBEL: ...to the top...)
(NEON: Rising...)
(REBEL: ...never stop...)
*808 fade*

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - trap intensity varies significantly
- Perfect for gym workouts, ambition playlists, hustle mindset
- Should feel dark and intense, not light or poppy
- CYPHER flow should be clear and motivational, not mumbled
- REBEL adds aggression without overwhelming verses
- NEON bridges provide brief melodic relief
- 808s should hit hard and be prominent in mix
- Hi-hats should be crisp and trap-style (rolls, triplets)
- If not hard enough, emphasize "hard 808s" and "aggressive"
