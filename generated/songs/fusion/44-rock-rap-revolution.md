## Lyrics

```
[Heavy guitar riff with 808s and live drums]

[Intro - REBEL]
(aggressive)
Revolution! Revolution!
(yeah!)
Time to burn it down!

[Verse 1 - REBEL rap]
(fierce flow)
They want us docile and compliant, following their rules (nah!)
But we're starting a revolution, we ain't nobody's tools! (tools!)
Rock and rap together, that's a dangerous combination (danger!)
Leading the resistance, this is our generation! (ours!)

Heavy guitar riffs backing up my aggressive flow (flow!)
808s with the mosh pit, putting on a show (show!)
Revolutionary mindset, tearing down the walls (walls!)
Rock rap fusion answering the battle calls! (calls!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX building]
(rock energy)
Can you hear the people rise?
Time to open up your eyes!

[Chorus - PHOENIX rock power + REBEL]
(explosive rock-rap)
ROCK RAP REVOLUTI-O-ON! (REBEL: revolution!)
WE'RE BREAKING FREE FROM THEIR SOLUTI-O-ON! (REBEL: break free!)
GUITAR RIFFS AND RAP FLO-O-OW! (REBEL: flow!)
TEARING DOWN THE STATUS QUO-O-O! (REBEL: tear it down!)
*heavy guitar with 808s*
(REBEL: Revolution! Revolution!)
*mosh pit energy*
Stand and fight! (REBEL: fight!)
Wrong from right! (REBEL: right!)
ROCK RAP REVOLUTI-O-ON! (REBEL: revolution!)
TONIGHT!

[Verse 2 - REBEL]
(aggressive energy)
System trying to suppress us but we're too damn loud (loud!)
Rock and rap rebellion representing for the crowd (crowd!)
Molotov cocktails made of metaphors and riffs (boom!)
Revolutionary fusion causing paradigm shifts! (shift!)

Question their authority with every bar I spit (spit!)
Guitar solos amplify the message, bit by bit (bit!)
This ain't entertainment, this is war on the establishment (war!)
Rock rap revolution, we won't be complacent! (nah!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX]
Can you hear the people rise?
Time to open up your eyes!

[Chorus - PHOENIX + REBEL]
ROCK RAP REVOLUTI-O-ON! (REBEL: revolution!)
WE'RE BREAKING FREE FROM THEIR SOLUTI-O-ON! (REBEL: break free!)
GUITAR RIFFS AND RAP FLO-O-OW! (REBEL: flow!)
TEARING DOWN THE STATUS QUO-O-O! (REBEL: tear it down!)
*heavy guitar with 808s*
(REBEL: Revolution! Revolution!)
*mosh pit energy*
Stand and fight! (REBEL: fight!)
Wrong from right! (REBEL: right!)
ROCK RAP REVOLUTI-O-ON! (REBEL: revolution!)
TONIGHT!

[Bridge - REBEL + PHOENIX trade]
(revolutionary peak)
*guitar solo underneath*
(REBEL: This is for the rebels!)
(PHOENIX: REBELS!)
(REBEL: This is for the fighters!)
(PHOENIX: FIGHTERS!)
(REBEL: This is for the ones who refuse to bow!)
(PHOENIX: REFUSE!)
(BOTH: ROCK RAP REVOLUTION NOW!)

[Breakdown - REBEL]
(half-time aggressive)
*heavy guitar breakdown*
(REBEL: Revolution! Revolution! Revolution! Revolution!)
*building back to full tempo*
(REBEL: Let's burn it down!)
(PHOENIX: BURN IT DOWN!)

[Final Chorus - Both maximum aggression]
(explosive rock-rap)
ROCK RAP REVOLUTI-O-ON! (everyone!)
WE'RE BREAKING FREE FROM THEIR SOLUTI-O-ON! (breaking free!)
GUITAR RIFFS AND RAP FLO-O-OW! (powerful!)
TEARING DOWN THE STATUS QUO-O-O! (tear it down!)
*heaviest guitar with 808s*
(REBEL: REVOLUTION! REVOLUTION!)
*maximum mosh energy*
Stand and fight! (fighting!)
Wrong from right! (right!)

- Should feel aggressive and revolutionary, not pop-friendly
- REBEL should sound fierce and commanding
- PHOENIX rock vocals should be powerful, not melodic pop
- Guitar should be heavy and prominent
- 808s should hit hard alongside live drums
- Breakdown section provides mosh pit moment
- Think Rage Against the Machine, Run the Jewels rock-rap energy
- If not aggressive enough, emphasize "heavy guitar" and "mosh pit"
