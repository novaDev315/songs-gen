- CYPHER rap should be triumphant, not aggressive
- PHOENIX choruses should feel stadium-ready and anthemic
- NEON harmonies blend pop and R&B sensibilities
- Strings should be epic but not overwhelming hip-hop elements
- Live drums + 808s create unique fusion percussion
- Bridge acknowledges different types of victors for inclusivity

- If too hip-hop, emphasize "stadium energy" and "epic strings"
