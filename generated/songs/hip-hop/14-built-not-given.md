## Lyrics

[Hard trap beat with aggressive 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Built not given, built not given!)
(CYPHER: Earned everything, facts!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Never had a handout, built it from the ground up, ground)
(CYPHER: They was born with silver spoons, I had to make my sound up, made)
(CYPHER: Everything I got today, I had to go and found it, found)
(CYPHER: Built not given, that's the difference, I'm surrounded, real!)

(CYPHER: Started with a dollar and a dream in my possession, one)
(CYPHER: Every single obstacle became another lesson, learn)
(CYPHER: They inherited success, I made it my profession, work)
(CYPHER: Built not given, that's the reason for progression, build!)

[Hook - REBEL]
(REBEL: BUILT NOT GIVEN! Earned!)
(REBEL: I made it on my own)
(REBEL: BUILT NOT GIVEN! Mine!)
(REBEL: Everything I own!)

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(NEON: I don't owe nobody nothing, not a thing)
(NEON: Built it from the ground, I'm coming, self-made)
(NEON: They was handed everything, silver spoon)
(NEON: Built not given, I'm the king, I'm the king!)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Self-made millionaire, I earned every single penny, count)
(CYPHER: They was getting handouts while my pockets wasn't plenty, broke)
(CYPHER: Built my empire brick by brick, the work was never ending, build)
(CYPHER: Now they want a piece, but I remember never lending, nah!)

(CYPHER: From the struggle to the hustle, from the bottom to the top, climb)
(CYPHER: From the nothing to the something, every blessing that I got, got)
(CYPHER: I constructed, never gifted, every dollar, every plot, plot)
(CYPHER: Built not given, that's forever, I don't need what you got! Never!)

[Hook - REBEL]
(REBEL: BUILT NOT GIVEN! Earned!)
(REBEL: I made it on my own)
(REBEL: BUILT NOT GIVEN! Facts!)
(REBEL: Everything I own!)

[Bridge - NEON]
(NEON: They don't know what hard work is...)
(NEON: I built this from the dust...)
(NEON: Self-made and I'm dangerous...)
(NEON: Built not given, that's a must...)

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
(CYPHER: This is for the builders who refused to take a handout) (NEON: never!)
(CYPHER: For the ones who made it happen when the haters had them counted out) (NEON: counted!)
(CYPHER: We don't need assistance, we just work until we stand out) (NEON: stand!)
(CYPHER: Built not given, that's the motto, now we own the damn house!) (NEON: OWN!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Built not given, built not given!)
(NEON: Self-made forever...)
(CYPHER: Earned it all!)
*Heavy 808 drop with trap drums*
