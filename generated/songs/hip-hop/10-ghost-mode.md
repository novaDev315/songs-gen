## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: Ghost mode, ghost mode!)
Silent grind (shh!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Disappeared into the shadows, put my phone on do not disturb (gone)
Working in the silence while they partying and poppin' herb (work)
They ain't heard from me in months, thought I fell off or hit the curb (nah)
Now I'm back with all this fire, watch them speechless, loss for words! (fire!)

Ghost mode activated, no more posting on the 'Gram (ghost)
Too busy executing every detail of the plan (execute)
While they flexing with the photos, I been building what I am (build)
Now I'm haunting all these demons, they don't know just where I stand! (stand!)

[Hook - REBEL]
GHOST MODE! (quiet!)
Moving in the dark, in the dark
GHOST MODE! (silent!)
Coming for their heart, for their heart!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
They thought I disappeared forever (where he go?)
I was building something better (building up)
Working through the stormy weather (rain and snow)
Ghost mode 'til I'm here, now I'm shining like a treasure, treasure!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Went invisible for eighteen months, no tweets, no interaction (ghost)
While they arguing on Twitter, I was building my attraction (build)
Cut off all the negativity, required subtraction (cut)
Now I'm back with all this energy, they seeing my reaction (boom!)

From the shadows to the spotlight, from the quiet to the loud (loud)
From the solo to the sold-out, now I'm surfing through the crowd (surf)
They was wondering where I went, but I was making mama proud (proud)
Ghost mode was the blueprint, now I'm standing on the cloud! (cloud!)

[Hook - REBEL]
GHOST MODE! (stealth!)
Moving in the dark, in the dark
GHOST MODE! (shock!)
Coming for their heart, for their heart!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
Silence was my strategy...
Working was my therapy...
Now they see my mastery...
Ghost mode to the galaxy...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
For the ones who move in silence, making moves without a sound (NEON: silent!)
For the ones who trust the process, plant the seeds beneath the ground (NEON: trust!)
We gon' shock them with the harvest, leave them shook and spell-bound (NEON: shock!)
Ghost mode 'til we ready, then we shake the whole town! (NEON: SHAKE!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Ghost mode, ghost mode!)
(NEON: Silent rise, we coming...)
(CYPHER: Shock the world, watch!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*
