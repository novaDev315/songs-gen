## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: Scars to stars, scars to stars!)
Pain is power (yeah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Every scar upon my chest is just a lesson that I learned (learned)
Every bridge that I was burning made me watch the tables turn (turn)
From the trauma to the triumph, I been waiting for my turn (wait)
Now my pain became my weapon, watch me let this whole thing burn! (burn!)

They inflicted all these wounds, tried to break me into pieces (break)
Now I'm using every bruise like it's my doctoral thesis (smart)
Turned my weakness to my strength, my depression to my genius (flip)
All my scars became my armor, now I'm different species! (beast!)

[Hook - REBEL]
SCARS TO STARS! (shine!)
Every wound became my light, my light
SCARS TO STARS! (rise!)
From the darkness to the bright, the bright!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
All my pain became my power (power up)
Every wound became my honor (wear them proud)
From the midnight to the morning hour (break of dawn)
Scars to stars, I'm standing taller, taller!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Wore my heart upon my sleeve, they ripped it off and left me bleeding (bled)
Now I'm dripping in success, they see me winning, they conceding (win)
All the backstabs made me sharper, now my vision superseding (sharp)
Every scar a constellation, I'm a galaxy proceeding (space!)

From the hospital to headlines, from the pain to the parade (up)
From the therapy to triumph, watch me dominate my trade (dominate)
They thought scars would make me weaker, but I turned into a blade (sharp)
Now my wounds are decorations for the empire I made! (made!)

[Hook - REBEL]
SCARS TO STARS! (glow!)
Every wound became my light, my light
SCARS TO STARS! (transcend!)
From the darkness to the bright, the bright!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
They tried to break me down to nothing...
But my scars taught me something...
Every wound became my launching...
Now I'm shining, now I'm stunning...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
For the ones who bear the weight of all the trauma they survived (NEON: survived!)
For the ones who turned their pain into the reason they alive (NEON: alive!)
We been scarred but we keep marching, yeah we more than just survived (NEON: marching!)
Every wound a star that's shining, now we finally arrived! (NEON: ARRIVED!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Scars to stars, scars to stars!)
(NEON: We shining bright, we shining...)
(CYPHER: Pain to power, watch!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*
