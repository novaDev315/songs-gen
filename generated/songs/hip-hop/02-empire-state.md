## Lyrics
```
[Orchestral strings with trap drums]

[Intro - REBEL]
(powerful)
I built an empire, brick by brick!
(yeah!)
They gonna remember this!

[Verse 1 - CYPHER storytelling]
Started with a vision in a one-room apartment (one room)
Now I got investments and they call me a sergeant (boss!)
Leading my own army through the concrete jungle (march!)
Made it from the bottom where the weak ones crumble (nah!)

Every scar became a lesson, every loss a blessing (blessed!)
Every closed door led me to a different section (facts!)
Built this kingdom with my bare hands and ambition (built!)
Now they write about my story, call it non-fiction (real!)

[Hook - REBEL + CYPHER]
(REBEL: EMPIRE STATE!)
(CYPHER: We run it!)
(REBEL: EMPIRE STATE!)
(CYPHER: They want it!)
(REBEL: But this throne belongs to us!)
(BOTH: Empire state of mind, yeah, built on trust!)

[Chorus - NEON melodic with strings]
(emotional auto-tune)
I can see my empire ri-i-ise...
Built it with these hands, no di-i-isguise...
Every stone I laid, every sacrifice...
Now I'm living in my empire, empire in the skies...

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Momentum building like I'm rolling down a mountain (roll!)
Started counting pennies, now I'm diving in the fountain (splash!)
Made some investments, yeah, they thought that I was clowning (ha!)
Now I'm wearing crowns and my success is so astounding (crown!)

Empire mindset, never thinking small scale (big!)
Built a legacy that's gonna outlive betrayal (last!)
They can't break these walls, reinforced like titanium (strong!)
Standing tall, empire mentality premium! (stand!)

[Hook - REBEL + CYPHER]
(REBEL: EMPIRE STATE!)
(CYPHER: We run it!)
(REBEL: EMPIRE STATE!)
(CYPHER: They want it!)
(REBEL: But this throne belongs to us!)
(BOTH: Empire state of mind, yeah, built on trust!)

[Bridge - NEON + orchestral swell]
(emotional peak)
From the ashes, I ro-o-ose...
Now everybody kno-o-ows...
This empire, mine alo-o-one...
Built a kingdom, built a home...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + REBEL adlibs]
(triumphant)
This is for the builders, not the critics on the sideline (REBEL: build!)
For the ones who took the risk and put it all on the line (REBEL: risk!)
For the dreamers who were told they'd never make it out (REBEL: dream!)
Now we sitting at the top and there's no room for doubt! (REBEL: EMPIRE!)

[Final Chorus - All Three]
(full orchestral + 808s)
(NEON: I can see my empire ri-i-ise...)
(CYPHER: Built it brick by brick, no compromise!)
(REBEL: EMPIRE STATE! EMPIRE STATE!)
(ALL: Standing tall, we gonna celebrate!)

[Outro - REBEL]
(strings fade with trap drums)
Empire... empire...
Built to last forever...
*orchestral hit + 808 drop*
```

## Why This Works
- **Orchestral + trap fusion**: Creates "empire" grandeur while keeping trap edge
- **CYPHER storytelling**: Perfect for the building narrative arc
- **NEON emotional contrast**: Adds vulnerability to triumph
- **REBEL commanding energy**: Imperial authority in delivery
- **Memphis trap foundation**: Harder-hitting than Atlanta trap
- **Brass stabs + strings**: Cinematic, empire-building atmosphere

## Generation Tips
- Generate 6+ variations - orchestral elements may vary significantly
- Try regenerating if strings overwhelm the 808s (balance is key)
- CYPHER's storytelling should feel conversational yet confident
- The bridge creates emotional peak before triumphant finale
