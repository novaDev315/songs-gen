## Lyrics

[Dark Memphis trap intro with heavy 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: They said I couldn't do it!)
Watch me prove 'em wrong (yeah!)
*bass drop*

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
They said I couldn't make it, said I'd never see the top (never!)
They was quick to hate it when I said I wouldn't stop (nah!)
They was placing bets against me, had me written off the list (off!)
Now I'm collecting every check, tell them haters blow a kiss (mwah!)

Remember when they laughed at me? (yeah!) Now they asking for a feature (facts!)
Remember when they passed on me? (uh!) Now I'm standing in the bleachers (high!)
Used to tell me lower expectations, keep it humble, keep it small (small)
Now I'm breaking every limitation, watch me conquer, watch me ball! (ball!)

[Hook - REBEL]
THEY SAID I COULDN'T! (but I did!)
Now I'm running up the digits (count!)
THEY SAID I COULDN'T! (watch me!)
But I'm winning, that's the business! (win!)

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
They said I couldn't reach the stars (they were wrong)
They said I'd never make it far (proved them wrong)
But now I'm driving foreign cars (skrrt, skrrt!)
They said I couldn't, but here we are, we are!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Every doubt became my fuel, every "no" became my mission (go!)
Every closed door made me ruthless, turned rejection to ambition (ambition!)
They was comfortable with losing, I was hungry for the vision (hungry!)
Now they switching up positions, now they wanting my attention! (switch!)

From the concrete where they counted me out (out!)
To the penthouse where there ain't no more doubt (none!)
Used to see me struggling, now they see me flexing (flex!)
Every blessing that I'm getting got them pressed and second-guessing! (pressed!)

Made a science out of grinding, multiplication of the grind (math!)
They was comfortable with finding, I was focused on the climb (climb!)
Now they calling me a genius, but they called me crazy first (crazy!)
They said I couldn't quench my demons, but I turned that hate to thirst! (thirst!)

[Hook - REBEL]
THEY SAID I COULDN'T! (lies!)
Now I'm living so explicit (yeah!)
THEY SAID I COULDN'T! (what!)
But I'm winning, can you get it? (get it!)

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
They said I wouldn't amount to nothing...
But I turned that pain to something...
Now I'm everything they said I couldn't be...
Look at me, look at me...
*808 hit*

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
This is for everyone who heard the "no" and kept on going (NEON: going!)
For the ones who faced the doubt but kept their confidence from showing (NEON: showing!)
We don't need their validation, we got everything we need (NEON: we got it!)
They said we couldn't do it? Watch us plant a different seed! (NEON: GROW!)

Every obstacle they threw at me became a stepping stone (step!)
Every negative prediction got me working for the throne (work!)
They said I couldn't, but I could and I did (did!)
Now I'm living proof that they were wrong about this kid! (wrong!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: They said I couldn't!)
(NEON: But we did it, yeah we did it...)
(CYPHER: They said I wouldn't!)
(NEON: But we lived it, yeah we lived it...)
(CYPHER: Now they see it!)
*808 fade with trap hi-hats*
