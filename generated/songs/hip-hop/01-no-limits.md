## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: No limits, no limits!)
They can't cage me (nah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Breaking through the ceiling, there's no limits to this feeling (none)
They been sleeping while I'm dealing, now the whole world's reeling (wake up)
From the bottom, now I'm stealing everything I'm feeling (mine)
Success is what I'm breathing, watch me feast like it's Thanksgiving (feast!)

Used to count my pennies, now I'm counting bigger figures (count)
Pull up in the city, yeah, I'm known as the go-getter (known)
They was sipping henny, I was plotting getting better (plot)
Now my name is heavy like I'm writing golden letters (heavy!)

[Hook - REBEL]
NO LIMITS! (none!)
I'ma take it all, take it all
NO LIMITS! (break it!)
Watch me as I ball, as I ball!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
There's no ceiling where I'm going (going high)
Seeds I planted now they're growing (watch them rise)
All the doubt that they were showing (they were wrong)
Now it's no limits, I'm just glowing, glowing!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Limitless ambition, that's the only thing that's working (work)
Every opposition, they be nervous when I'm lurking (lurk)
Made it my decision, I'm allergic to the hurting (allergic)
Now I'm on a mission, closing curtains, that's for certain (close!)

From the dirt to designer, from the struggle to the throne (up)
From the hurt to the highlight, built this castle all alone (built)
Now they want to ride, but I remember being stone cold (cold)
No limits to my grind, watch me turn my pain to gold! (gold!)

[Hook - REBEL]
NO LIMITS! (none!)
I'ma take it all, take it all
NO LIMITS! (sky high!)
Watch me as I ball, as I ball!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
They said I'd never make it out...
But look at me right now...
Breaking through without a doubt...
No limits, I'ma show them how...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + REBEL adlibs]
This is for the dreamers who refuse to play it safe (REBEL: safe!)
For the ones who see the vision even when there's no escape (REBEL: vision!)
We be racing to the finish, leaving haters in our wake (REBEL: wake!)
No limits to our business, watch us win at every stake! (REBEL: WIN!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: No limits, no limits!)
(NEON: Sky high, we flying...)
(CYPHER: Can't stop, won't stop!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*
