## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: Pressure makes diamonds, diamonds!)
Compress me (yeah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Apply the pressure, watch me turn into a jewel (shine)
They tried to stress me, but I turned it into fuel (gas)
Adversity my teacher, learning lessons that are cruel (learn)
But pressure makes diamonds, now I'm playing by my rules (rules!)

They put me under weight, thought that I would fold and break (nah)
But I just meditate, calculate my next move, wait (wait)
Compressed into greatness, all the hate just makes me great (great)
Diamond in the rough now, watch me elevate! (up!)

[Hook - REBEL]
PRESSURE MAKES DIAMONDS! (shine!)
The heat don't break me down
PRESSURE MAKES DIAMONDS! (bright!)
I wear the hardest crown!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
When they squeeze me, I just crystalize (I shine)
Every challenge makes me realize (I'm strong)
That the pressure is what makes me rise (I grow)
Pressure makes diamonds, that's no surprise, -prise!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Compressed under stress but I never show the cracks (never)
They tried to test me, yeah, but I just counterattack (fight)
The pressure blessed me, made me harder than the facts (hard)
Turned my pain to power, diamonds forming in the stack (stack!)

From the darkness into sparkle, that's the story that I tell (story)
From the hardship into art, yeah, I turned my living hell (art)
Every scar is like a mark of all the times that I prevailed (won)
Pressure makes diamonds, I'm the proof that I excel! (proof!)

[Hook - REBEL]
PRESSURE MAKES DIAMONDS! (facts!)
The heat don't break me down
PRESSURE MAKES DIAMONDS! (crown!)
I wear the hardest crown!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
They applied the pressure...
But I became better...
Now I shine forever...
Carbon to a treasure...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + REBEL adlibs]
This is for the warriors who face the toughest trials (REBEL: trials!)
For the ones who turn the pressure into victory and smiles (REBEL: victory!)
We be shining through the darkness, going mile after mile (REBEL: mile!)
Pressure makes diamonds, we been cooking for a while! (REBEL: SHINE!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Pressure makes diamonds!)
(NEON: Watch me crystallize...)
(CYPHER: Unbreakable now!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*
