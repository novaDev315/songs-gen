[Rolling hi-hats intro]

[Intro - REBEL]
The grind NEVER stops! (never!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER rapid]
Seven days a week, I'm always on the move (move!)
Grind never stops, got nothing to prove (nah!)
Action after action, never hitting pause (pause!)
This relentless drive is written in my laws! (law!)

[Hook - REBEL]
GRIND! (grind!)
NEVER! (never!)
STOPS! (stops!)
CLIMB! (climb!)
EVERY! (every!)
TOP! (top!)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
Sunrise to sunset, I'm chasing greatness (chase!)
Grind never stops, embracing the patience! (wait!)

[Bridge - REBEL]
No breaks! No stops! No limits! NO TOPS!

[Breakdown - CYPHER rapid]
Wide awake! (awake!)
No mistake! (mistake!)
What it take! (it take!)
Never break! (never!)
NO SLEEP MODE!
*bass punch*
