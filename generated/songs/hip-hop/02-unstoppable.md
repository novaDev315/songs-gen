## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: Unstoppable, unstoppable!)
Can't slow me down (nah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
I'm a force of nature, yeah they can't contain the pressure (nope)
Every move a power play, I'm getting bigger, better (flex)
They thought they could brake me, but I'm built for any weather (storm)
Momentum like a freight train, watch me roll forever (roll!)

Used to face resistance, now they clearing out the pathway (move)
Every single instance, turned my struggles to a payday (pay)
They was talking distance, I was focused on the relay (run)
Now I'm in existence where the winners come to play, aye! (play!)

[Hook - REBEL]
UNSTOPPABLE! (yeah!)
Can't hold me back, hold me back
UNSTOPPABLE! (go!)
I'm on attack, on attack!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
Watch me blow through every obstacle (can't stop me)
They throwing stones but I'm untouchable (I'm moving)
My energy is so unstoppable (momentum)
No brakes on this, it's undeniable, -able!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Accelerating daily, never stopping for a second (vroom)
Every wall they gave me, turned into a stepping session (step)
Made them underestimate me, now they learning me a lesson (learn)
Speed of light intensity, I'm flexing every blessing (flex!)

From the ground up moving forward like a rocket to the stars (up)
From the doubt to moving onward, breaking through them prison bars (break)
Used to pray for better days, now I'm setting my own bars (set)
Unstoppable momentum, I'm collecting all the scars! (scars!)

[Hook - REBEL]
UNSTOPPABLE! (yeah!)
Can't hold me back, hold me back
UNSTOPPABLE! (run it!)
I'm on attack, on attack!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
Try to stop me, it won't work...
I been grinding since my birth...
Every setback made me worse...
Unstoppable, that's my worth...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + REBEL adlibs]
This is for the hustlers who keep pushing past the limits (REBEL: limits!)
For the ones who face the struggle but they never quit it (REBEL: never!)
We be running through the jungle, catching everything we visit (REBEL: catch!)
Unstoppable ambition, watch us ball like it's our scrimmage! (REBEL: BALL!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Unstoppable, unstoppable!)
(NEON: Keep moving, can't stop...)
(CYPHER: Forever, let's go!)
