## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: Ten years deep, ten years deep!)
Overnight success (ha!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
They think I just appeared, like I manifested from the air (nah)
Don't see the thousand hours grinding when nobody was there (grind)
The sleepless nights of writing, all the moments of despair (dark)
Now they call it overnight, but I been grinding everywhere! (everywhere!)

Five years in the basement with no windows and no views (dark)
Working two jobs in the morning, making music when I'm through (work)
Seven hundred songs rejected, yeah they all gave me the blues (nah)
Now they say I'm overnight when I been paying all my dues! (dues!)

[Hook - REBEL]
OVERNIGHT? (nah!)
This took years of pain, years of pain
OVERNIGHT? (lies!)
Blood and sweat and rain, sweat and rain!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
They see the glory, miss the story (miss it all)
Think it's easy, but it's gory (blood and war)
Ten years grinding in the quarry (break the stone)
Call it overnight, but this is years of glory, glory!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Started from my bedroom, seventeen with just a laptop (young)
Now they see me on the screen and think I hit the jackpot (think)
Didn't see me skip my prom to master every single ad-lib (skip)
Didn't see the sacrifice, they just assume I had it (nah!)

From the open mics where only three people would show (empty)
To the arenas where a hundred thousand people might go (packed)
This "overnight" was decades grinding in the snow (cold)
But they only see the harvest, never see me plant and grow! (grow!)

[Hook - REBEL]
OVERNIGHT? (fake!)
This took years of pain, years of pain
OVERNIGHT? (real!)
Blood and sweat and rain, sweat and rain!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
Ten years in the shadows working...
Nobody was watching, lurking...
Now they think it's overnight...
But I been grinding out of sight...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
This for everyone who's grinding when the world is fast asleep (NEON: asleep!)
For the ones who plant the seeds knowing it'll take some weeks (NEON: weeks!)
We gon' shock them with the harvest, let them call it what they speak (NEON: speak!)
"Overnight" took years of struggle, now we finally reached the peak! (NEON: PEAK!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Ten years deep, overnight!)
(NEON: We earned this, we earned it...)
(CYPHER: Years of work, one day!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*
