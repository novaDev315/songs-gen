[Heavy 808 intro]

[Intro - REBEL]
Hustle hard or go home! (facts!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Started with a dollar and a dream in my pocket (one!)
Now I'm building rockets, they can't stop it (nah!)
Hustle in my DNA, born to grind (born!)
Success is the only thing on my mind! (only!)

[Hook - REBEL + CYPHER]
HUSTLE HARD! (hard!)
PLAY HARD! (hard!)
Work smart, that's the master card! (smart!)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
Morning to the night, I'm on my grind (grind!)
Hustle hard mentality, refined! (refined!)

[Bridge - REBEL]
(powerful)
Push harder! Go farther! Be smarter!

[Outro]
