## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: Throne talk, throne talk!)
Crown on my head (yeah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Sitting on the throne like I'm royalty and such (king)
Built my own empire, yeah they can't say much (built)
Golden crown heavy but I earned it with my touch (earned)
Throne talk only, if you speaking, better clutch (clutch!)

They want the position but they don't want the work (nah)
Want to sit in luxury but can't handle the hurt (soft)
I'm the ruler of this kingdom, watch me move like I'm berserk (move)
Throne secured forever, I'm the benefit and perk! (throne!)

[Hook - REBEL]
THRONE TALK! (yeah!)
I'm the king, I'm the queen
THRONE TALK! (reign!)
Running everything you seen!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
Sitting on my throne looking at the view (so high)
Everything I own, everything I do (it's mine)
Kingdom that I've grown, palace coming through (I reign)
Throne talk baby, I'm the chosen few, the few!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Coronation celebration, I've been waiting for this moment (wait)
Crown fits perfect on my head, yeah I own it, I don't loan it (own)
Every move is royal status, I decree it and I bone it (king)
Throne is mine by right of conquest, I'm the chosen, I'm the poet (chosen!)

From the gutter to the palace, I'm ascending to the peak (up)
From the struggle to the chalice, drinking victory so sweet (drink)
Now I'm ruling with an iron fist, they bow down at my feet (bow)
Throne talk is the only language when the royals come to speak! (speak!)

[Hook - REBEL]
THRONE TALK! (crown!)
I'm the king, I'm the queen
THRONE TALK! (reign!)
Running everything you seen!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
I'm sitting at the top now...
Can't nobody knock me down...
Earned my jewels and crown...
This throne is mine, I'm renowned...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
This is for the leaders who refuse to be a peasant (NEON: peasant!)
For the ones who see the throne and know their presence is a present (NEON: present!)
We be ruling with conviction, making history every second (NEON: history!)
Throne talk energy, we regal, our ascension is a blessing! (NEON: CROWN!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Throne talk, throne talk!)
(NEON: Long live the reign...)
(CYPHER: Royal forever!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*
