## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Breakthrough, breakthrough!)
(CYPHER: Shatter limits, yeah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Breaking through the walls they built to keep me in my place, break)
(CYPHER: Every barrier they threw at me, I'm smashing face to face, smash)
(CYPHER: They tried to cap my potential, tried to slow down my pace, nah)
(CYPHER: Now I'm breaking through the ceiling, leaving nothing but a trace! Gone!)

(CYPHER: Concrete couldn't hold me, chains couldn't restrain me, no)
(CYPHER: Glass ceiling shattered when they tried to contain me, shatter)
(CYPHER: Every obstacle they threw became a stepping stone, step)
(CYPHER: Now I'm breaking through dimensions, claiming everything I own! Own!)

[Hook - REBEL]
(REBEL: BREAKTHROUGH! Smash!)
(REBEL: I'm destroying every wall, every wall)
(REBEL: BREAKTHROUGH! Crash!)
(REBEL: Watch me conquer it all, conquer all!)

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(NEON: Breaking through the limitations, break them down)
(NEON: Shattering expectations, all around)
(NEON: This is my emancipation, freedom found)
(NEON: Breakthrough moment, pure elation, elation!)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Started in a box they built, with walls on every side, boxed)
(CYPHER: Told me "stay in your lane," but I refused to just comply, nah)
(CYPHER: Kicked down every barrier, watched them crumble as I ride, kick)
(CYPHER: Now I'm breaking through to levels that they tried so hard to hide! Hide!)

(CYPHER: From the basement to the penthouse, broke through every single floor, up)
(CYPHER: From the doubters to believers, broke through every single door, through)
(CYPHER: They said "you can't," I said "watch me," now they asking for encore, watch)
(CYPHER: Breaking through is just my nature, always hungry wanting more! More!)

[Hook - REBEL]
(REBEL: BREAKTHROUGH! Boom!)
(REBEL: I'm destroying every wall, every wall)
(REBEL: BREAKTHROUGH! Pow!)
(REBEL: Watch me conquer it all, conquer all!)

[Bridge - NEON]
(NEON: Nothing's gonna stop me now...)
(NEON: I just had my breakthrough, wow...)
(NEON: Breaking every ceiling, how...)
(NEON: This is my moment, here and now...)

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
(CYPHER: This for everyone who's fighting through the walls that hold them back) (NEON: fighting!)
(CYPHER: For the ones who see the vision even when the world is black) (NEON: vision!)
(CYPHER: We gon' break through every barrier, we staying on attack) (NEON: attack!)
(CYPHER: Breakthrough is our destiny, there's nothing that we lack!) (NEON: BREAKTHROUGH!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Breakthrough, breakthrough!)
(NEON: We unstoppable, we soaring...)
(CYPHER: Nothing stops us, watch!)
