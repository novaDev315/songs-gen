## Lyrics

[Ominous synth build with distant laughter sample]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(menacing: Ha ha ha ha!)
Who's laughing now? (me!)
I got the last laugh! (yeah!)
*bass drop with evil laugh*

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
They counted me out, had me down for the count (down!)
Now I'm counting these stacks, unlimited amount (count!)
Karma came around like a boomerang effect (swing!)
I got the last laugh, put some respect on my check! (respect!)

Used to talk behind my back, thought I'd never hear the noise (heard!)
Now I'm making all the moves, they just playing with their toys (play!)
Time revealed the truth, separated girls from boys (truth!)
I got the last laugh echoing, can you hear the voice? (ha!)

[Hook - REBEL]
LAST LAUGH! (ha ha!)
I'm the one who's winning now (winning!)
LAST LAUGH! (facts!)
Watch me turn it all around! (around!)

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
They laughed first but I laugh last (I'm laughing)
They moved slow but I moved fast (I'm running)
The tables turned, the die is cast (it's over!)
I got the last laugh, built to last, to last!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Vindication feels so sweet when you feast after the famine (feast!)
When the people who dismissed you start to panic, start to panic (panic!)
Karma is a patient teacher, took some time but now they see (see!)
The last laugh is the loudest when you rise up from your knees! (rise!)

They was writing my obituary, planning out my funeral (dead!)
Now I'm living legendary, everything is beautiful (live!)
Used to wish the worst for me, now they watching my success (watch!)
I got the last laugh tattooed right across my chest! (tatted!)

Remember every slight, every shade, every hate (every!)
Turned it to my motivation, used it all to elevate (up!)
Now I'm at the summit while they scrambling at the gate (gate!)
Last laugh is prophetic when you let the karma wait! (wait!)

[Hook - REBEL]
LAST LAUGH! (mine!)
I'm the comeback story now (story!)
LAST LAUGH! (yeah!)
Tell me who's the glory now? (me!)

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
They tried to write me off the script...
But karma never missed a hit...
Now I'm standing on the cliff...
I got the last laugh, gift after gift...
*808 rumble*

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
This is for the ones who smiled when you were down and out (NEON: fake!)
For the snakes who reconciled when they saw what you're about (NEON: snakes!)
We don't need to say I told you, let the actions do the talking (NEON: talk!)
I got the last laugh, hear it echo while I'm walking! (NEON: HA!)

Every setback was a setup for this moment right here (here!)
Every tear became a weapon, turned my pain into a spear (spear!)
They was laughing at my vision, but the vision was so clear (clear!)
Last laugh sounds like victory ringing in your ear! (ring!)

Karma kept the score, balanced every wrong with right (balanced!)
Now I'm soaring with the eagles while they swimming in their spite (fly!)
They was hoping I would fail, but I turned into a light (shine!)
Last laugh is eternal when you win the final fight! (fight!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Ha ha ha ha!)
(NEON: We got the last laugh now...)
(CYPHER: Who's laughing now?)
(NEON: Karma came around...)
(CYPHER: Can't stop this!)
*evil laugh sample with 808 fade*
