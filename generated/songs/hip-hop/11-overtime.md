## Lyrics

[Fast trap beat]

[Intro - REBEL]
(hype)
Working OVERTIME! (overtime!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Clock don't stop and neither do I (nope!)
Twenty-four seven grinding, reaching for the sky (fly!)
While they sleeping, I'm out here making moves (moves!)
Got that overtime mentality, nothing to lose! (none!)

[Chorus - NEON]
Workin' o-o-overtime... (overtime!)
This is my-y-y grind time... (grind time!)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
Extra hours, extra effort, extra pay (extra!)
Overtime lifestyle every single day! (day!)

[Bridge - All]
(CYPHER: No breaks!)
(REBEL: No sleep!)
(NEON: Just grind!)

[Outro]
*808 fade*
```
