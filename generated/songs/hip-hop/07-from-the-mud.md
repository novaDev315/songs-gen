## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: From the mud, from the mud!)
Dirt to diamonds (yeah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Started from the bottom where the pavement was my mattress (mud)
Now I'm moving faster than a bullet, causing havoc (fast)
Used to count my losses, now I'm counting all these assets (count)
From the projects to the profit, watch me flip it like gymnastics (flip!)

Wore the same shoes for a year, had the soles falling off (worn)
Now I'm stepping in designer, feeling like a boss (boss)
They was laughing at my dreams, said I'd never make it far (nah)
Now I pulled up in the beam, dirt to diamonds, I'm a star! (star!)

[Hook - REBEL]
FROM THE MUD! (rise!)
I was born to shine, born to shine
FROM THE MUD! (climb!)
Watch me take what's mine, take what's mine!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
I came up from nothing, now they see me (see me glow)
All that struggle made me hungry, now I'm eating (now I grow)
From the trenches to the top, I keep achieving (keep it going)
From the mud to the mansion, now believe me, believe me!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Remember days with empty pockets, water soup for dinner (broke)
Now my whole team eating lobster, we some different winners (eat)
From the gutter to the glitter, dirt beneath my nails (dirt)
Turned my pain into my power, now I'm destined to prevail (win!)

Used to sleep on mama's couch, rats was in the kitchen (rats)
Now I own a penthouse, life a different vision (own)
They can't comprehend the mission, how I turned the mud to gold (gold)
From the struggle comes the wisdom, watch my legacy unfold! (unfold!)

[Hook - REBEL]
FROM THE MUD! (rise!)
I was born to shine, born to shine
FROM THE MUD! (straight up!)
Watch me take what's mine, take what's mine!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
Came from the dirt, now I'm clean...
Living out my wildest dreams...
Nothing's ever what it seems...
From the mud, I found my gleam...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
This for everybody sleeping in they cars tonight (NEON: tonight!)
For the ones who eating ramen, but they got the fight (NEON: fight!)
We gon' make it from the bottom, keep the vision tight (NEON: tight!)
From the mud we build our kingdoms, watch us reach new heights! (NEON: HEIGHTS!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: From the mud, from the mud!)
(NEON: We rising up, we rising...)
(CYPHER: Dirt to diamonds, watch!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*
