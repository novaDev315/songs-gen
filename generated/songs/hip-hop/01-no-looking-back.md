## Lyrics
```
[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - REBEL hype]
(yeah, yeah!)
No looking back, no looking back!
(we gone!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Twenty-twenty vision but I never look behind me (nah)
All these new blessings, yeah, they came to find me (facts)
Used to be anonymous, now they can't define me (who?)
Crown on my head and the spotlight's blinding (bright!)

They was sleeping on me like a mattress sale (sleep!)
Now I'm selling out shows, yeah, I never fail (sold out!)
Started in the gutter, now I'm living like a king (king!)
Every door I touch turns to diamond, everything! (bling!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON melodic]
(auto-tune smooth)
I remember nights I had no-o-othing...
Now I got everything and I'm still hunting...
They can't stop me, no, they can't stop me...

[Chorus - NEON + REBEL adlibs]
(NEON: No looking ba-a-ack!) (REBEL: never!)
(NEON: I'm on a different tra-a-ack!) (REBEL: facts!)
(NEON: They see me rising fa-a-ast!)
(REBEL: And we ain't slowing down! yeah!)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER fast flow]
Accelerate, I'm pushing like a hundred in the fast lane (zoom!)
Elevate above the hate, I turned my loss to champagne (pop!)
They was throwing shade, but now they know my last name (know it!)
Hall of fame status while they stuck playing the same game (same!)

Obstacles became stepping stones to the throne (step!)
Every setback set me up for the zone (zone!)
I'm a different breed, yeah, I'm built from the unknown (built!)
Now they study my success like I'm carved in stone! (study!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON]
I remember nights I had no-o-othing...
Now I got everything and I'm still hunting...
They can't stop me, no, they can't stop me...

[Chorus - NEON + REBEL adlibs]
(NEON: No looking ba-a-ack!) (REBEL: never!)
(NEON: I'm on a different tra-a-ack!) (REBEL: facts!)
(NEON: They see me rising fa-a-ast!)
(REBEL: And we ain't slowing down! yeah!)

[Bridge - CYPHER + NEON harmonies]
(CYPHER: This is for the ones who doubted me...)
(NEON: ...who thought I'd never be...)
(CYPHER: Now I'm living out my wildest dreams!)
(BOTH: No looking back! No looking back!)

[Final Chorus - All Three]
(explosive energy)
(NEON: No looking ba-a-ack!)
(REBEL: NEVER! WE GONE!)
(CYPHER: Different track, different path, yeah!)
(NEON: Rising fa-a-ast...)
(ALL: And we ain't slowing down!)

[Outro - REBEL]
(fade with 808s)
No looking back... (echo)
*bass drop*

## Why This Works
- **CYPHER lead**: Aggressive, confident rap delivery perfect for triumph narrative
- **NEON melodic hooks**: Auto-tune smoothness creates emotional contrast
- **REBEL hype adlibs**: Adds energy and attitude throughout
- **4-7 descriptors**: Atlanta trap, dark hip-hop, triumphant, specific vocal styles
- **Heavy 808 bass**: Matches "Crown Season" production style
- **Negative descriptors**: "no pop, no acoustic" prevents style drift

## Generation Tips
- Generate 6+ variations for best results
- Try both 140 BPM and 150 BPM versions
- Suno may interpret CYPHER's fast flow differently each time
- The bridge creates emotional peak before final chorus
- Perfect for motivation/workout playlists
