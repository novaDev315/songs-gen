## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: Built different, built different!)
Not like them (nah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Different breed, different code, I don't operate the same (nope)
Different seed, different road, I don't play nobody's game (mine)
Got a different kind of mindset, never looking for the fame (look)
Built different from the onset, remember when I came! (came!)

They conform to fit the mold, I be breaking every pattern (break)
While they fold, I'm getting bold, watch my empire expand and fatten (grow)
They been told what path to hold, I'm the one who's out here snapping (snap)
Different soul, I'm in control, hear my legacy when I'm rapping (rap!)

[Hook - REBEL]
BUILT DIFFERENT! (yeah!)
They can't understand my way
BUILT DIFFERENT! (own lane!)
I don't follow, I just slay!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
I'm not built like everybody else (I'm unique)
Different DNA, I do it for myself (my way)
They try to copy but they need some help (can't clone)
Built different, yeah I'm wealth, I'm wealth!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Wired different, think different, move different than the rest (move)
Fire in me, dream bigger, prove different, I'm the best (best)
No comparison, they staring cause I'm wearing success like a vest (flex)
Separating from the average, I'm a different type of blessed (blessed!)

From a different cloth, different sauce, different vision in my eyes (see)
Different cost, never lost, different mission to the skies (fly)
They be soft, I'm a boss, different rhythm, different vibe (boss)
Built different by design, watch me rise above the lies! (rise!)

[Hook - REBEL]
BUILT DIFFERENT! (facts!)
They can't understand my way
BUILT DIFFERENT! (special!)
I don't follow, I just slay!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
They don't get me and that's fine...
I was made to shine...
Different by divine design...
This is my time, my time...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + REBEL adlibs]
This is for the outsiders who never fit the system (REBEL: system!)
For the ones who write their own rules and refuse to be a victim (REBEL: refuse!)
We built different from the start, yeah we got that special prism (REBEL: prism!)
Different heart, different art, we don't need their permission! (REBEL: BUILT!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Built different, built different!)
(NEON: One of one, I'm rare...)
(CYPHER: Can't duplicate this!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*
