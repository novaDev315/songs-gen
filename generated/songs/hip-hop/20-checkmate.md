## Lyrics

[Chess piece moving sound effect with menacing synth]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(calculated: Checkmate!)
I planned this from the start (yeah!)
Every move was art (facts!)
*king falling sound with bass drop*

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
I've been playing chess while they was playing checkers (chess!)
Made strategic moves, turned my haters into spectators (watch!)
Every setback was a setup for a greater play (setup!)
Checkmate! I've been planning this for many days! (days!)

Bishop to the corner, knight jump, queen attack (move!)
Rook controlling columns while I'm planning my attack (plan!)
They was moving pawns while I was seeing eight moves deep (deep!)
Checkmate! Now they realize I never sleep! (never!)

[Hook - REBEL]
CHECKMATE! (done!)
I outsmarted all the hate (smart!)
CHECKMATE! (yeah!)
Every move was calculated! (calculated!)

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
I've been moving pieces, playing long game (playing smart)
While they chasing clout, I was making my name (making moves)
Strategic with the vision, never playing tame (calculated!)
Checkmate, checkmate, I just won the game, the game!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Sacrificed my comfort for position on the board (sacrifice!)
Traded instant pleasure for a legacy and more (more!)
While they celebrated pawns, I was building up my force (build!)
Checkmate! They didn't see me plotting out my course! (course!)

Every "no" I got became a lesson in disguise (learn!)
Every closed door taught me how to strategize (strategize!)
I was patient like a grandmaster seeing through the lies (patient!)
Checkmate! Watch the king fall right before your eyes! (fall!)

Three dimensions while they thinking linear and flat (3D!)
I was stacking wins while they was comfortable with that (stack!)
Saw the whole board while they focusing on single moves (see!)
Checkmate! I'm the proof that strategy improves! (proof!)

[Hook - REBEL]
CHECKMATE! (king down!)
Outsmarted everyone who played (played!)
CHECKMATE! (facts!)
Victory was always in the way I played! (played it!)

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
They didn't see the master plan unfold...
But every move I made was bold...
Now the victory is mine to hold...
Checkmate, checkmate, watch the story told, it's told...
*chess clock ticking with 808*

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
This is for the thinkers who play chess, not checkers (NEON: thinkers!)
For the ones who plan ahead and don't need checkers (NEON: plan!)
We don't rush the process, we just calculate and strike (NEON: strike!)
Checkmate! We're the kings and queens who own the night! (NEON: KINGS!)

En passant with the hate, turned it to my advantage (move!)
Castle to protect my dreams, queen out causing damage (queen!)
Fork your whole strategy, pin you to your pride (pin!)
Checkmate! I'm the grandmaster, there's nowhere to hide! (hide!)

Every critic was a pawn I sacrificed to gain space (space!)
Every doubter was a piece I used to win the race (race!)
Calculated every risk, never moved without a reason (calculated!)
Checkmate! I'm the champion of every season! (champion!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Checkmate!)
(NEON: The game is over now...)
(CYPHER: King is down!)
(NEON: I'm wearing victory's crown...)
(CYPHER: Strategic!)
*chess piece falling with 808 fade and hi-hats*
