## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(aggressive: Self made, self made!)
Built this myself (yeah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Started from nothing, didn't have a silver spoon (none)
Built this from the ground up, hungry like it's noon (starving)
No handouts, no shortcuts, I created my own tune (mine)
Self made millionaire mindset, coming very soon (soon!)

They was born with connections, I was born with just a dream (dream)
While they made their selections from the privilege that they seen (seen)
I was grinding every second, building up my own regime (grind)
Self made from the bottom, now I'm running my own team! (team!)

[Hook - REBEL]
SELF MADE! (yeah!)
Didn't need nobody's help
SELF MADE! (built!)
Everything I got, I dealt!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
No family money, no connections (just me)
Built my empire in my own direction (my way)
Every brick I laid with my own hands (I built)
Self made, now they understand, -stand!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Architect of my own destiny, no blueprints from another (nah)
Built my legacy independently, didn't need a mother or a brother (solo)
Self-financed, self-advanced, made my stance without a buffer (hard)
Now I'm getting what I manifested, watch me stack and stack and suffer! (stack!)

From the basement to the penthouse, every step I took alone (alone)
From the pavement to the best route, built this castle, built this throne (built)
Never waited for a handout, made my own way, made it known (known)
Self made warrior, I'm a soldier, I'm the one who owns the zone! (own!)

[Hook - REBEL]
SELF MADE! (facts!)
Didn't need nobody's help
SELF MADE! (real!)
Everything I got, I dealt!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
Nobody gave me nothing...
I just kept on hustling...
Now my story's something...
Self made from the struggling...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + REBEL adlibs]
This is for the grinders who refuse to beg for favors (REBEL: favors!)
For the ones who build their own, creating their own flavors (REBEL: create!)
We be writing our own story, cutting through like we got lasers (REBEL: lasers!)
Self made champions, we don't need no life savers! (REBEL: MADE!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Self made, self made!)
(NEON: From the ground up...)
(CYPHER: No handouts, let's go!)
*808 fade with hi-hats*

- CYPHER dominates with self-reliant, proud delivery and versatile flow (65-70%)
- REBEL provides edgy hooks with attitude (15-20%)

## Generation Tips
- Generate 6+ variations
- Emphasize stark, minimal production to represent "starting from nothing"
- The melodic chorus should feel triumphant and accomplished
- Fast flow in Verse 2 may need regeneration for clarity
- Consider building production complexity as song progresses (mirrors building success)
- Use powerful 808 drops to emphasize self-made achievements
