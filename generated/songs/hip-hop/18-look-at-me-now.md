## Lyrics

[Menacing synth intro with 808 rumble]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(confident: Look at me now!)
From the bottom to the crown (yeah!)
Look at me now! (what!)
*808 drop*

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
They was laughing when I started, thought my dreams were just a joke (joke!)
Now they choking on their words, yeah, they gag and then they choke (choke!)
Used to mock me at the parties, now they begging for invoke (beg!)
Look at me now, I'm the fire, watch me turn into the smoke! (smoke!)

Remember when you played me? (yeah!) Treated me like I was nothing (nothing!)
Remember when you played safe? (uh!) While I was out here hustling (hustle!)
Now you see me on your TV, in your playlists, in your face (face!)
Look at me now, I'm the standard, set the tempo, set the pace! (go!)

[Hook - REBEL]
LOOK AT ME NOW! (look!)
From the mockery to the crown (crown!)
LOOK AT ME NOW! (yeah!)
Used to laugh, but who's laughing now? (who!)

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
They used to laugh, now they stare (now they watching)
Used to mock, now they care (now they talking)
From the bottom to up there (way up high!)
Look at me now, I'm everywhere, everywhere!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Drastic transformation, caterpillar to a butterfly effect (fly!)
Used to treat me like a peasant, now they show me some respect (bow!)
Evolution of a savage, went from nothing to a threat (threat!)
Look at me now, I'm the lesson that they never will forget! (never!)

From the ridicule to revenue, from the jokes to getting paid (paid!)
From invisible to interviews, from the shade to center stage (stage!)
They was comfortable ignoring me, I made them look away (look!)
Now they can't avoid the story, I'm the headline every day! (every day!)

Used to sit at empty tables, now I'm dining with the elite (elite!)
Used to walk in dirty sneakers, now it's custom on my feet (custom!)
They was quick to call me crazy when I spoke about my goals (goals!)
Look at me now, I'm the proof that you can change your life and soul! (soul!)

[Hook - REBEL]
LOOK AT ME NOW! (see it!)
I'm the one they couldn't hold down (nah!)
LOOK AT ME NOW! (facts!)
Tell me who's the one that's shining now? (me!)

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
You didn't believe in what I could become...
Now you're speechless, feeling dumb...
Look at me now, look at what I've become...
The transformation has begun, begun...
*bass hit*

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
This is for the underdogs who turned into the wolves (NEON: wolves!)
For the ones they overlooked who came back breaking rules (NEON: breaking!)
We don't need their validation, we just need to see it through (NEON: through!)
Look at me now, look at us, we're the living proof! (NEON: PROOF!)

From the doubt to the dynasty, from the mock to the monument (build!)
From the hate to the harmony, every moment was a component (piece!)
They said look at you back then? Well, look at me right now! (now!)
I'm the definition of a transformation, take a bow! (bow!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Look at me now!)
(NEON: From the bottom to the top, yeah...)
(CYPHER: Who's laughing now?)
(NEON: We ain't ever gonna stop, no...)
(CYPHER: Can't stop this!)
*808 fade with hi-hat rolls*
