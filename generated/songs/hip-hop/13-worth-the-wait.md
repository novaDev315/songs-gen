## Lyrics

[Dark atmospheric trap beat]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Worth the wait, worth the wait!)
(CYPHER: Timing perfect, yeah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Patience is a weapon when you know what's coming next, know)
(CYPHER: While they rushing to the finish, I been playing chess, chess)
(CYPHER: Waited for my moment, now I'm different from the rest, different)
(CYPHER: Timing was the secret, now I'm passing every test, pass!)

(CYPHER: They was moving fast, but I was moving calculated, wait)
(CYPHER: Every single setback had me hungry, never hated, hungry)
(CYPHER: Planted all my seeds and then I waited 'til they made it, grow)
(CYPHER: Now I'm reaping benefits, the timing was vindicated, facts!)

[Hook - REBEL]
(REBEL: WORTH THE WAIT! Yeah!)
(REBEL: Everything I prayed for)
(REBEL: WORTH THE WAIT! All!)
(REBEL: Got what I was made for!)

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(NEON: Good things come to those who wait, patience paid)
(NEON: Grinding while I cultivate, I create)
(NEON: They was early, I was late, perfect time)
(NEON: Now it's worth the wait, I'm feeling great, so great!)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Delayed but not denied, that's the motto I've been living, live)
(CYPHER: Every no I got before just made me more forgiving, soft)
(CYPHER: Waited for the right time, now the whole world is giving, give)
(CYPHER: Patience turned to power, now I'm winning, that's a given, win!)

(CYPHER: From the years of preparation to the moment of arrival, here)
(CYPHER: From the doubt to celebration, witness tactical survival, survive)
(CYPHER: They thought I was finished, but I waited for revival, back)
(CYPHER: Worth the wait, I'm in my prime, this is more than just survival! Prime!)

[Hook - REBEL]
(REBEL: WORTH THE WAIT! Facts!)
(REBEL: Everything I prayed for)
(REBEL: WORTH THE WAIT! Mine!)
(REBEL: Got what I was made for!)

[Bridge - NEON]
(NEON: All those years of silent grinding...)
(NEON: Now the stars are all aligning...)
(NEON: Waited for my perfect timing...)
(NEON: Worth the wait, the silver lining...)

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
(CYPHER: This is for the patient ones who never lost the faith) (NEON: faith!)
(CYPHER: For the ones who understood good things are worth the wait) (NEON: wait!)
(CYPHER: We don't rush the process, we just dominate our fate) (NEON: dominate!)
(CYPHER: Worth the wait, we coming late but still we own the plate!) (NEON: OWN!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Worth the wait, worth the wait!)
(NEON: Perfect timing...)
(CYPHER: Right on time!)
