## Lyrics

[Dark trap beat with rolling 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: No days off, no days off!)
(CYPHER: Grind don't stop, never!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Seven days a week, I'm hustling, ain't no days off, none)
(CYPHER: They be taking breaks while I'm out here getting paid off, paid)
(CYPHER: Sleeping is for dreamers, I'm awake until I take off, fly)
(CYPHER: Every single hour got me closer to the payoff, facts!)

(CYPHER: Wake up, it's a race, got no time for hesitation, go)
(CYPHER: While they sleeping in, I'm putting work into creation, work)
(CYPHER: Building empires daily with my grit and dedication, build)
(CYPHER: They want vacations, I want domination, no vacation, grind!)

[Hook - REBEL]
(REBEL: NO DAYS OFF! None!)
(REBEL: Sun up to sun down)
(REBEL: NO DAYS OFF! Work!)
(REBEL: Watch me get this crown!)

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(NEON: While they rest, I'm getting better, better now)
(NEON: Grinding hard through any weather, rain or shine)
(NEON: They ain't built like me, whatever, they ain't me)
(NEON: No days off, I grind forever, ever!)

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(CYPHER: Calendar is empty, every day the same objective, work)
(CYPHER: Clock is never friendly when your goals are so aggressive, tick tock)
(CYPHER: Sleep is for the weak, I'm collecting and perfecting, perfect)
(CYPHER: Rest can wait until I'm legendary, that's perspective, legend!)

(CYPHER: From the Monday morning madness to the Sunday grind, all week)
(CYPHER: Every single moment, yeah, I'm focused on the climb, up)
(CYPHER: They be counting weekends, I be counting dollar signs, count)
(CYPHER: No days off until I'm at the top, that's by design! Design!)

[Hook - REBEL]
(REBEL: NO DAYS OFF! None!)
(REBEL: Sun up to sun down)
(REBEL: NO DAYS OFF! Let's go!)
(REBEL: Watch me get this crown!)

[Bridge - NEON]
(NEON: They don't see the sacrifice...)
(NEON: Working through the lonely nights...)
(NEON: One day all this pain gon' price...)
(NEON: No days off until I rise...)

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
(CYPHER: This is for the hustlers who don't know when to quit) (NEON: never!)
(CYPHER: For the ones who understand it's grind over sleep) (NEON: grind!)
(CYPHER: We be working overtime while they relaxing on the beach) (NEON: beach!)
(CYPHER: No days off until we own everything we seek!) (NEON: SEEK!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: No days off, no days off!)
(NEON: Grinding forever...)
(CYPHER: Can't stop, won't stop!)
