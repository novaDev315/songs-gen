## Lyrics
```
[Jazz piano sample with boom bap drums]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(reflective)
This is for the legacy...
Everything I leave behind...

[Verse 1 - CYPHER storytelling]
Started with a pen and a dream in my notebook (write!)
Now I'm writing chapters that the whole world took (read!)
Not just making music, man, I'm making history (facts!)
Every bar I write becomes a part of my mystery (real!)

Thinking 'bout the impact, not just the immediate (think!)
Legacy's the marathon, success is just the preview, it (run!)
Building something lasting that'll outlive my existence (last!)
Every word I speak with purposeful persistence (speak!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON soulful]
(smooth)
What we leave behind... defines who we are...
Building something bigger... reaching for the stars...

[Chorus - NEON + CYPHER]
(melodic)
This is FOREVER! (CYPHER: forever!)
More than just a moment, this is FOREVER! (CYPHER: legacy!)
This is FOREVER! (CYPHER: forever!)
Building something timeless, this is FOREVER!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
Not concerned with trends, I'm invested in the timeless (time!)
Every move I make, calculated, never mindless (think!)
Planting seeds today that'll grow into tomorrow (grow!)
Building bridges out of everything I borrowed (build!)

This ain't just about the money or the fame, nah (nah!)
It's about the message that remains when I'm gone, yeah (yeah!)
Impact over income, legacy over luxury (choose!)
Building something permanent, that's what moves me! (move!)

[Bridge - CYPHER + NEON harmony]
(introspective)
(CYPHER: Every word I write...)
(NEON: ...lives on forever...)
(CYPHER: Every life I touch...)
(NEON: ...connected together...)
(BOTH: This is forever...)

[Final Chorus - Both]
This is FOREVER! (forever!)
More than just a moment, this is FOREVER! (legacy!)
This is FOREVER! (forever!)
Building something timeless, this is FOREVER!

[Outro - CYPHER]
(fade with piano)
Legacy in every line...
Forever in the mind...
*jazz sample fades*
