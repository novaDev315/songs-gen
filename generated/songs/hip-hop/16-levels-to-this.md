## Lyrics

[Layered dark trap beat with massive 808s]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(superior: Levels to this, levels to this!)
Different tier (yeah!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER]
Understand there's levels to this game I'm playing daily (levels)
They be on the ground floor while I'm elevated greatly (high)
Operating different, yeah, the gap is never shaky (never)
Levels to this greatness, I'm the boss, they work for me (boss!)

Level one is basics, that's where everybody starting (start)
Level ten is mastery, that's where I'm charting (chart)
They be stuck on level three while I'm departing (bye)
Levels to this excellence, I'm off the grid, I'm sparking (spark!)

[Hook - REBEL]
LEVELS TO THIS! (up!)
I'm on a different floor
LEVELS TO THIS! (high!)
They can't reach no more!

[Chorus - NEON with auto-tune]
(melodic)
I'm on another level now (ascended)
Different class, I'm special now (I'm blessed)
They can't compete, I'm several now (levels up)
Levels to this, I'm next level, I'm level!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
Hierarchy established, I'm the top of the pyramid (top)
They be on the bottom wondering how the hell I did it (how)
Levels to this mastery, the gap is so significant (gap)
Every time they level up, I'm already magnificent (gone!)

From the rookie to the pro, from the floor to the penthouse (climb)
From the bottom to the throne, I'm the one they can't discount (king)
Every level that I reach, I just open up another (more)
Levels to this greatness, I'm above them like a mother! (mother!)

[Hook - REBEL]
LEVELS TO THIS! (boss!)
I'm on a different floor
LEVELS TO THIS! (facts!)
They can't reach no more!

[Bridge - NEON]
(emotional auto-tune)
They still learning how to walk...
I'm already learning how to fly...
Boss level, yeah, I talk...
Levels to this, touch the sky...

[Verse 3 - CYPHER + adlibs]
This is for the bosses who leveled up with patience (NEON: patience!)
For the ones who climbed so high they in a different location (NEON: location!)
We don't play on easy mode, we master complications (NEON: master!)
Levels to this greatness, we the highest in the nation! (NEON: HIGH!)

[Outro - Both]
(CYPHER: Levels to this, levels to this!)
(NEON: Next level...)
(CYPHER: Can't touch this!)

- REBEL's hooks should exude attitude and edge
- Layered synths should literally sound like ascending levels
- NEON's auto-tune should sound like reaching new heights
- 808s should hit harder with each section (level up sonically)
- Second verse's faster flow shows moving through levels quickly
- Add pitched vocal chops for Travis Scott influence
- Wide stereo imaging for modern trap sound
- 145 BPM, E minor key for dark atmospheric feel
- Ad-libs should emphasize height and superiority
- Consider ascending pitch or key changes for level-up effect
