[Banjo riff with 808 bass]

[Intro - CYPHER]
(country drawl)
Back roads hustle, yeah...
Country grind, all the time...
(let's go!)

[Verse 1 - CYPHER country rap]
(Southern flow)
Wake up on the farm but I'm thinking like a boss (boss!)
Dirt under my nails but I'm counting up the cost (count!)
Rural route hustle, that's the way I operate (operate!)
Small town dreams but I'm thinking pretty great! (great!)

Tractor in the morning, laptop in the eve (both!)
Country boy hustler, making folks believe (believe!)
You ain't gotta leave the land to make your stand (nah!)
Back roads empire, that's what I demand! (demand!)

Country strong with a hustler's mind (mind!)
Blend the old school with the modern grind (grind!)
From the barn to the bank, watch me elevate (up!)
Back roads hustle, this is country fate! (fate!)

[Pre-Chorus - CYPHER + PHOENIX]
(building)
(CYPHER: From the backwoods to the big bucks...)
(PHOENIX: We don't need no luck!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX country power]
(country anthem)
BACK ROADS HU-U-USTLE! (working!)
THAT'S THE COUNTRY MU-U-USCLE! (muscle!)
WE DON'T QUIT, WE DON'T STOP! (never!)
GRINDING FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP! (to the top!)
Small town roots, big city dreams! (dreams!)
Ain't as simple as it seems! (nah!)
BACK ROADS HU-U-USTLE! (hustle!)
THAT'S OUR COUNTRY THEME!

[Verse 2 - CYPHER]
(faster flow)
They think country means you moving kinda slow (slow?)
But my hustle's turbo, watch my empire grow (grow!)
Banjo and the bass, that's my signature sound (sound!)
Country rap fusion taking over every town! (town!)

From the pickup truck to the business lunch (both!)
Punch the clock then punch my goals, one-two punch! (punch!)
Rural route millionaire, that's the mindset here (here!)
Back roads hustle, making it crystal clear! (clear!)

Overalls and business calls, I do it all (all!)
Spring, summer, winter, fall, I stand tall (tall!)
Country authenticity meets urban energy (energy!)
Back roads hustle is my legacy! (legacy!)

[Pre-Chorus - CYPHER + PHOENIX]
(CYPHER: From the backwoods to the big bucks...)
(PHOENIX: We don't need no luck!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + CYPHER]
BACK ROADS HU-U-USTLE! (CYPHER: hustle!)
THAT'S THE COUNTRY MU-U-USCLE! (CYPHER: muscle!)
WE DON'T QUIT, WE DON'T STOP! (CYPHER: nah!)
GRINDING FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP! (CYPHER: top!)
Small town roots, big city dreams! (CYPHER: dreams!)
Ain't as simple as it seems! (CYPHER: nah!)
BACK ROADS HU-U-USTLE! (CYPHER: hustle!)
THAT'S OUR COUNTRY THEME!

[Bridge - CYPHER + PHOENIX trade]

(CYPHER: This is for the country hustlers! Grinding every day!)
(PHOENIX: Working hard and staying humble!)
(CYPHER: That's the country way!)

(CYPHER: We keep it real!)
(BOTH: BACK ROADS HUSTLE, THAT'S THE APPEAL!)

[Final Chorus - Both maximum fusion]
(country rap anthem)
