## Lyrics

```
[Acoustic guitar with steel guitar accent]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(authentic country)
Down that dirt road...
Where dreams are born...

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
Grew up on a dirt road, dust cloud in my wake (dust!)
Every pothole taught me lessons, every turn a choice to make (choice!)
Mama said "dream big," daddy said "work hard" (work!)
Now I'm chasing down my destiny, playing every card! (play!)

Gravel under tires sounds like opportunity (sounds!)
Every mile I drive feels like I'm breaking free (free!)
From the city lights to the country night (night!)
These dirt road dreams are burning bright! (bright!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(building)
(NEON: From the backroads to the big stage...)
(PHOENIX: I'm writing my own page!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON country harmony]
(heartland anthem)
DIRT ROAD DRE-E-EAMS! (NEON: dreams!)
AIN'T AS SIMPLE AS THEY SEE-E-EEM! (NEON: as they seem!)
BUT I'LL KEEP ON FIGHTIN' FOR WHAT I BELIE-E-EVE! (NEON: believe!)
THESE DIRT ROAD DREAMS ARE CARRYING ME! (NEON: carrying me!)
From the country to the crown! (NEON: to the crown!)
I ain't letting nothing bring me down! (NEON: bring me down!)
DIRT ROAD DRE-E-EAMS! (NEON: dreams!)
THAT'S ALL I NEED!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(storytelling)
Pickup truck and a tank of gas, heading toward the sun (heading!)
Small town roots but big city aspirations, having fun (fun!)
Every dusty mile reminds me where I'm from (from!)
But these dirt road dreams won't quit until I've won! (won!)

Steel guitar singing songs of truth and grit (truth!)
Country strong, I'm built for this, I won't quit (nah!)
From the farmhouse to the big house, watch me climb (climb!)
These dirt road dreams are mine, it's my time! (time!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: From the backroads to the big stage...)
(PHOENIX: I'm writing my own page!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
DIRT ROAD DRE-E-EAMS! (NEON: dreams!)
AIN'T AS SIMPLE AS THEY SEE-E-EEM! (NEON: as they seem!)
BUT I'LL KEEP ON FIGHTIN' FOR WHAT I BELIE-E-EVE! (NEON: believe!)
THESE DIRT ROAD DREAMS ARE CARRYING ME! (NEON: carrying me!)
From the country to the crown! (NEON: to the crown!)
I ain't letting nothing bring me down! (NEON: bring me down!)
DIRT ROAD DRE-E-EAMS! (NEON: dreams!)
THAT'S ALL I NEED!

[Bridge - PHOENIX country storytelling]
(emotional peak)
(soft to building)
I remember sitting on the porch, stars above...
Mama telling me to chase my dreams with love...
Daddy working sunrise to sunset every day...
Now I'm living proof that hard work pays!

[Final Chorus - Both powerful country]
(full heartland production)
DIRT ROAD DRE-E-EAMS! (so real!)
AIN'T AS SIMPLE AS THEY SEE-E-EEM! (nothing simple!)
BUT I'LL KEEP ON FIGHTIN' FOR WHAT I BELIE-E-EVE! (always believe!)
THESE DIRT ROAD DREAMS ARE CARRYING ME! (carrying me!)
From the country to the crown! (to the crown!)
I ain't letting nothing bring me down! (never!)
DIRT ROAD DRE-E-EAMS! (my dreams!)
THAT'S ALL I NEED!

[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]
(fade with acoustic guitar)
(PHOENIX: Down that dirt road...)
(NEON: ...where dreams come true...)
(PHOENIX: These country dreams...)
(NEON: ...they see me through...)
*steel guitar fade*
