Champion rodeo, this is my claim to fame! (fame!)

Buckle up and hold on tight, it's gonna be a ride (ride!)
Country tough and rodeo rough, wearing it with pride (pride!)
Every competition makes me sharper than before (sharp!)
Now I'm standing in the ring, ready to score! (score!)

## Why This Works

- **Country anthem energy**: Arena-ready, crowd-participation country
- **PHOENIX powerful country**: Commands attention with authority
- **REBEL hype sections**: Adds excitement and crowd energy
- **135 BPM**: Fast enough for excitement, perfect for country anthem
- **Major key**: Triumphant, victorious, celebratory tone
- **Rodeo theme**: Authentic country competition metaphor
- **Triumphant horns**: Adds victory celebration atmosphere
- **Crowd chant sections**: Creates arena participation moments

## Generation Tips

- Generate 6+ variations - arena energy will vary
- Perfect for sports events, competition themes, victory celebrations
- Should feel like arena country, not pop country
- PHOENIX needs commanding, powerful country vocals
- REBEL adds excitement without overshadowing country vibe
- Horns should be triumphant but not overwhelming
- Bridge crowd chant creates participation moment
- Think Garth Brooks, Chris LeDoux rodeo country energy
- If too pop, emphasize "arena country energy" and "triumphant"
