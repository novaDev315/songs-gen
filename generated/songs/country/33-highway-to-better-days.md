## Lyrics

```
[Upbeat acoustic guitar with driving rhythm]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(hopeful)
On the highway... to better days...
(yeah!)
Leaving yesterday behind!

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
(optimistic)
Rearview mirror's full of lessons from the past (past!)
But I'm looking straight ahead, driving pretty fast (fast!)
Every mile marker says I'm closer to my dreams (close!)
Highway to better days, or so it seems! (seems!)

Windows down, wind blowing through my hair (wind!)
Freedom's calling and I'm almost there (there!)
Radio playing songs about redemption and rebirth (songs!)
On this highway, heading to what I'm worth! (worth!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(building optimism)
(NEON: Open road ahead, skies are clear and blue...)
(PHOENIX: Better days are waiting, breaking through!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON uplifting]
(driving country anthem)
HIGHWAY TO BETTER DA-A-AYS! (NEON: better days!)
LEAVING ALL THE PAIN BEHIND IN A HA-A-AZE! (NEON: in a haze!)
DRIVING TOWARDS THE SU-U-UNRISE! (NEON: sunrise!)
WATCHING MY NEW LIFE MATERIALI-I-IZE! (NEON: realize!)
Mile by mile, I'm getting closer! (NEON: closer!)
To the life I chose, yeah! (NEON: I chose!)
HIGHWAY TO BETTER DA-A-AYS! (NEON: days!)
THAT'S WHERE THIS ROAD GOES!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(energetic)
GPS ain't necessary when you're following your heart (heart!)
Every turn I take's a brand new start (start!)
Destination: happiness, prosperity, and peace (peace!)
On this highway, all my worries cease! (cease!)

Tank is full, the journey's just begun (begun!)
Chasing down horizons and the setting sun (sun!)
Better days are more than just a dream (more!)
They're a destination on this highway supreme! (supreme!)

[Pre-Chorus - NEON + PHOENIX]
(NEON: Open road ahead, skies are clear and blue...)
(PHOENIX: Better days are waiting, breaking through!)

[Chorus - PHOENIX + NEON]
HIGHWAY TO BETTER DA-A-AYS! (NEON: better days!)
LEAVING ALL THE PAIN BEHIND IN A HA-A-AZE! (NEON: in a haze!)
DRIVING TOWARDS THE SU-U-UNRISE! (NEON: sunrise!)
WATCHING MY NEW LIFE MATERIALI-I-IZE! (NEON: realize!)
Mile by mile, I'm getting closer! (NEON: closer!)
To the life I chose, yeah! (NEON: I chose!)
HIGHWAY TO BETTER DA-A-AYS! (NEON: days!)
THAT'S WHERE THIS ROAD GOES!

[Bridge - PHOENIX hopeful with NEON]
(emotional optimism)
(PHOENIX: Every mile's a memory I'm making...)
(NEON: ...every turn's a chance I'm taking...)
(PHOENIX: Every sign points to tomorrow!)
(NEON: ...leaving behind all the sorrow!)
(building)
(BOTH: We're on the highway! To better days!)
(BOTH: No more detours! No more delays!)

[Final Chorus - Both maximum optimism]
(uplifting country)
HIGHWAY TO BETTER DA-A-AYS! (so bright!)
LEAVING ALL THE PAIN BEHIND IN A HA-A-AZE! (gone away!)
DRIVING TOWARDS THE SU-U-UNRISE! (new day!)
WATCHING MY NEW LIFE MATERIALI-I-IZE! (it's real!)
Mile by mile, I'm getting closer! (so close!)
To the life I chose, yeah! (my choice!)
HIGHWAY TO BETTER DA-A-AYS! (better days!)
THAT'S WHERE THIS ROAD GOES!
(THAT'S WHERE THIS ROAD GOES!)

[Outro - PHOENIX + NEON]
(fade with acoustic guitar)
(PHOENIX: Highway to better days...)
(NEON: ...we're on our way...)
(PHOENIX: Better days ahead...)
(BOTH: ...that's what we said...)
*acoustic guitar fade*
