## Lyrics

```
[Electric guitar with country twang]

[Intro - PHOENIX]
(gritty)
Boots on the ground!
(yeah!)
That's how we get it done!

[Verse 1 - PHOENIX]
(country rock power)
Five AM alarm, coffee black as coal (black!)
Lace up these work boots, ready for the toll (ready!)
Calloused hands tell stories, every scar's a badge (badge!)
I'm blue collar proud, living on the edge! (proud!)

No silver spoons, just steel-toed boots (steel!)
Working for a living, staying true to roots (roots!)
Sweat equity, that's my investment plan (sweat!)
Building up my empire with these working hands! (hands!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX building]
(country rock energy)
When the work needs doing, I don't hesitate!
Boots on the ground, that's how I operate!

[Chorus - PHOENIX country rock power]
(explosive)
BOOTS ON THE GRO-O-OUND! (working!)
THAT'S WHERE SUCCESS IS FO-O-OUND! (found it!)
AIN'T AFRAID OF HARD WORK OR GETTING DIRTY! (nah!)
BOOTS ON THE GROUND, UP EARLY PAST THIRTY! (grinding!)
FROM SUNUP TO SUNDOWN! (all day!)
I'M GONNA EARN MY CROWN! (earn it!)
BOOTS ON THE GRO-O-OUND! (boots!)
THAT'S HOW I GO-O-O DOWN!

[Verse 2 - PHOENIX]
(gritty authenticity)
Paycheck earned, not given, that's the country way (earned!)
Every dollar's got my fingerprints, I'll proudly say (mine!)
Boss of my own life, CEO of grind (boss!)
Blue collar millionaire mentality in mind! (rich!)

Truck bed full of tools and determination (tools!)
Building my success without no hesitation (build!)
Hard hat, work gloves, that's my business suit (suit!)
Everything I got comes from these boots! (boots!)

[Pre-Chorus - PHOENIX]
When the work needs doing, I don't hesitate!
Boots on the ground, that's how I operate!

[Chorus - PHOENIX]
BOOTS ON THE GRO-O-OUND! (working!)
THAT'S WHERE SUCCESS IS FO-O-OUND! (found it!)
AIN'T AFRAID OF HARD WORK OR GETTING DIRTY! (nah!)
BOOTS ON THE GROUND, UP EARLY PAST THIRTY! (grinding!)
FROM SUNUP TO SUNDOWN! (all day!)
I'M GONNA EARN MY CROWN! (earn it!)
BOOTS ON THE GRO-O-OUND! (boots!)
THAT'S HOW I GO-O-O DOWN!

[Bridge - PHOENIX country rock storytelling]
(powerful)
*guitar solo*
(over solo)
This is for the workers! (workers!)
The builders and makers! (makers!)
The ones who understand! (understand!)
Success is built by hand!

[Final Chorus - PHOENIX maximum country rock]
(explosive energy)
BOOTS ON THE GRO-O-OUND! (every day!)
THAT'S WHERE SUCCESS IS FO-O-OUND! (right there!)
AIN'T AFRAID OF HARD WORK OR GETTING DIRTY! (bring it!)
BOOTS ON THE GROUND, UP EARLY PAST THIRTY! (always!)
FROM SUNUP TO SUNDOWN! (working!)
I'M GONNA EARN MY CROWN! (earning!)
BOOTS ON THE GRO-O-OUND! (my boots!)
THAT'S HOW I GO-O-O DOWN!
(THAT'S HOW I GO DOWN!)

[Outro - PHOENIX]
(fade with electric guitar)
Boots on... (echo)
Working hard... (echo)
Blue collar proud... (echo)
*final guitar chord*
